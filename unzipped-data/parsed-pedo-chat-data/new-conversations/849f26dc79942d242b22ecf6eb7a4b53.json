        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (10:56): f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb, re: XML Maturity",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (10:57): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: yes you can agree with the sentence in the spec, but that doesn't mean that the sentence is appropriate in the spec",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (10:59): dunno, XHTML wouldn't work for authors and would not be as bacwards compatible as HTML",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (10:59): generally speaking",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:00): remember, 95% of the web is _syntactically_ incorrect",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:01): that doesn't make xhtml bad. It's why I propose the first paragraph, saying basically. &quot;Be careful if you use XHTML&quot;.",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:01): instead of the sentence &quot;XML sucks&quot;",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:01): I think it will help to keep the tones friendly",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:02): and to avoid endless recurring debates",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:02): does it say XML sucks currently?",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:03): well yes, I see how people can read that.",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:03): and we had comments like this",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:04): &quot;Generally speaking, authors are discouraged from trying to use XML on the Web, because XML has much stricter syntax rules than the &quot;HTML5&quot; variant described above, and is relatively newer and therefore less mature.&quot;",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:04): is what it says",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:05): we should not discourgared anything",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:06): and this will raise the hair of more than one persons &quot;and is relatively newer and therefore less mature.&quot;",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:06): anyway",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:06): I have already said what I had to say",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:06): Practically speaking, that statement will likely never survive LC comments.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:07): I agree with Karl. I think the decision to use XHTML or HTML should be up to the author, the spec should only give advise on technical issues",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:07): Well put.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:08): Except that instead of just advice, I would say it should give objection descriptions of conformant UA behavior.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:09): fwiw, I don't care much about whether it stays in the spec, it's just that I agree with the sentence",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:09): &quot;objection descriptions&quot;? Do you mean objective?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:09): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 - yeah. Freudian slip there :)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:09): what it says is pretty objective, both statements are factually correct",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:10): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 - great. Keep it in there then. If it's objective, then nobody can take issue with it of course.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:10): why not?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:11): people take issue with most things",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (11:11): indeed, you are doing right now ;) birthday party too long?",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:12): the spec may be be technically objective as-is, but it's just not worth debating the issue with those who object.  It's easier to just change the wording.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:12): So why give them more ammunition?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:12): amen",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:12): We have much more important battles to fight here.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:13): Providing the peanut gallery with more stuff to chime in on is maybe not too prudent.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:16): Anyway, to point out something really positive that's happened recently, note that a rep from Access (makers of NetFront browser) has joined the group and been posting to the list.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:17): and to <email/>, I see",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:18): The NetFront browser engine is used in embedded applications all over the place, so their participation will definitely help to provide a broader perspective on browsing use cases and requirements."
