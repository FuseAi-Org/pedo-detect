        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (23:47): well, I do understand you point, and maybe that's not a solution... we are still gathering information",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:48): I want to make sure supporting &quot;text-align: left&quot; is allowed",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (23:49): sure, of course",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (23:49): we could add language to that effect",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (23:49): which would actually be good, IMO, so that vendors could experiment",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:50): and should therefore *be* non-standard",
