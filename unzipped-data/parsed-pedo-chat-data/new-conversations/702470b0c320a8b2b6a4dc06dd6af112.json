        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:22): It can be a square, no problem.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (20:22): Rama's a perfectly fine ringworld as well.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:22): If it was somewhere in the middle it'd look silly",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:24): Well, yes, there are multiple routes to the same point and it's less trivial in some cases to figure out which is shortest.",
