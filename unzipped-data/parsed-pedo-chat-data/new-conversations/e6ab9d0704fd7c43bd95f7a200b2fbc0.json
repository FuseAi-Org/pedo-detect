        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:16): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: even taking that assumption as a given, the further conclusions don't make sense, so I decided not to argue with it",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:17): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: but it does seem so hypothetical that it's not a very strong argument against API convenience",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:18): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: I noticed you had mentioned XMLSerializer in the logs",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:19): it was incidental to the topic (which was Selectors API enhancements)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:20): I think the fact that WebKit serializes HTML DOMs as HTML was totally an accident",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:20): and I'm surprised and alarmed that sites ever came to depend on it",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:21): if MySpace is the only significant breakage, and if it can be fixed, then yes I think it is fixable",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:23): I.e. WebKit does &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; rather than &lt;div/&gt;",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:24): if that created compatibility issues in specific contexts, we could change it",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:25): well, we didn't make a conscious choice to apply it to XMLSerializer specifically",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:25): so would the agreeable convergence target be taking the WebKit XML-side behavior and making it standard on both HTML and XML trees?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:25): we decided to do that based on other contexts that serialize to XML (possibly even native APIs) and decided to do it everywhere",
