        "4f8dc60f261d2b7b4c52c15cd5ccd177 (03:26): the get/set are used when: Var = Object.Property; or Object.Property = Var;",
        "1c0de9bd43ae302260a0d0997d2ed075 (03:26): is there perhaps a nice faq page?",
        "4f8dc60f261d2b7b4c52c15cd5ccd177 (03:27): a dictionary or hashtable is a class so its passed by reference",
        "1c0de9bd43ae302260a0d0997d2ed075 (03:27): (i assumes it is a faq)",
        "4f8dc60f261d2b7b4c52c15cd5ccd177 (03:27): if you want to add stuff to it, just do Object.Property.Add(stuff);",

        "4f8dc60f261d2b7b4c52c15cd5ccd177 (03:34): with a property, the get{} set{} things are only used when assignment happens to/from the property",
        "4f8dc60f261d2b7b4c52c15cd5ccd177 (03:34): so there is only going to be &quot;value&quot;",

        "4f8dc60f261d2b7b4c52c15cd5ccd177 (03:36): because add is a method of the object the property is set to, not the class the property is in",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (03:36): for real anyway",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (03:37): I usually check out blender.org for new releases and toy with those for a while, but that's basicly it",

        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (03:47): but I hit the limits of what was possible to do with it at the time, basicly",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (03:48): so I dropped it and started using XSI instead",
        "4f8dc60f261d2b7b4c52c15cd5ccd177 (03:48): i feel sorry for you Macke",
