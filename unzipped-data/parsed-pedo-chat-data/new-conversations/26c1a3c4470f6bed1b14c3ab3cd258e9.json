        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:27): Presumably for flexibility.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:28): You can pulse different number of times, different durations, etc.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:29): well, have an @rule for keyframes then",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:29): and another one for named animations",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:29): @keyframes { ... }",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:29): @animation throb { ... }",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:30): I don't think you're gaining anything over specifying the animation properties then.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:30): you gain not having so many properties",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:30): Is that a problem?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:30): you're proposing to multiply by three",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:30): yes",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:31): it's a lot of overhead",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:31): The alternative is to put them together, but have a way of specifying whether it's an in, out, or during animation.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:32): also, comma-separated lists are unweildy",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:32): if you have an @rule, you can define a more sane syntax",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:32): You'd need comma separated lists anyway, no?  To separate out multiple animations?  Or are you thinking just a space-separate list of animations?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:32): yeah, but then it's just a list of animation names",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:33): you dont' have to match up across properties",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:33): This wouldn't make transitions any less full-of-properties.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:33): it would",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:33): why wouldn't it?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:34): If you define stuff in an at-rule and reference it later, the stuff in the at-rule isn't a property",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:34): @font-face defines a bunch of stuff",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:34): Transitions would still need their (somewhat smaller) set of properties, since they don't do anything with keyframes or animations at all.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:34): well, yeah",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:34): and for more complicated things they can use the same syntax to get names and timing functions and stuff",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:35): I think animations only have two more properties beyond transitions, though.  Is that enough to justify changing how you treat their shared properties?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:37): yeah, I don't know",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:37): btw, one thing I don't like in your proposal is that that you have to know the duration of the play-in animation in order to time the play-during one",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:38): seems like there should be some automatic way to handle that",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:38): also",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:38): hooking together three animations requires that they connect up in a reasonable way, no?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:39): you can't stop anytime in the middle of play-during and immediately start play-out if they're animating the same properties, otherwise it'll skip frames or something",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:39): Mm, true about needing an automatic way to start a play-during animation.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:40): anyway, I don't really have intelligent comments to make on this stuff. should go back and finish the minutes",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:40): hopes she can find all the relevant IRC logs",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:41): Perhaps one could leave the &quot;from&quot; keyframe selector out, and automatically grab the value that the previous class of animation had?",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:41): I think there might be some nice automatic way to smoothly transition between animations.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:41): (pun intended)",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:46): thinks transitioning animation-duration will lead to some interesting effects",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:47): I think the draft actually says that the values of the animation-* properties are frozen when the animation starts.  ^_^",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:47): (for the purposes of that animation)",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:47): oh, so you can't slow something down as you unhover?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:47): :)",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (09:48): luckily, no ^_^",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (09:53): So what if I want to spin down a spinny thing as you unhover?"
