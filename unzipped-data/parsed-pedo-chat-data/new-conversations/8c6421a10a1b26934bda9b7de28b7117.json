        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (18:35): 171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39: I think that disqualifies you from being &quot;just&quot; an author",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (18:36): If you are also a spec author and a browser developer",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:36): Sure, I'm not &quot;just&quot;, but that doesn't make me &quot;not&quot;.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (18:38): No but it does make your opinion less relevant on questions aimed discerning what the average author would find intuitive",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:39): Bah.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:39): My opinion as an &quot;average&quot; author was compromised long ago, when I started caring about standards.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:41): Hmm.  I wonder how using &lt;details&gt; for a tablist would work, if you ripped out the &lt;summary&gt;s via CSS to display together.  Sounds like it has potential.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:48): I forget - does [open] on details reflect the current open state?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:48): yes",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:48): kk",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:49): that might also cause mutating on parsing given a preference to open all &lt;details&gt; by default",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:49): and maybe when printing",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:49): Yeah, sure.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:49): I don't like it at all for that reason",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:49): That's what you want, in terms of styling, though.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:50): for styling we could just have :open",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:50): Well, I suppose you could just introduce :open, yeah.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:50): would be more consistent too",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:50): Either way works for me.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:50): Bug Hixie on it, then.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:50): why do I need to use :checked here and [open] there? aaah",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:50): Yeah, good argument.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:50): I failed to convince him",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:50): You actually file a bug?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:50): and I don't care enough I guess; I just think it's silly",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:51): no",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:51): k, I'll do so.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:51): good luck, you got my vote",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:51): How would it be reflected, then?  defaultOpen, like muted and value?",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:51): How does checked reflect?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:52): .checked is the actual value, .defaultChecked is checked=&quot;&quot; and [checked]",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (18:52): Okay, cool.",
