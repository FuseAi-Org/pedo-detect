        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:41): do you mean as far as W3C process, or something else?",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (05:42): currently in working draft, I assume the next is candidate recommendation",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:43): yeah, that's the next big step",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:43): but prior to that there's another step",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:43): which is so-called Last Call",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:43): which is actually more like First Call",
        "ced6bfe1f650f6b338594d37eb7850d2 (05:43): How long is the Last Call?",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (05:44): Is there a tentative eta for that mike?",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:45): the date we are aiming to start LC is May 22",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:46): and what LC at W3C means is that the group must record every comment it receives about the spec during the LC period",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:47): and at the end of the LC period, publish a report listing the &quot;disposition&quot; for every comment",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:50): what the HTML WG is doing right now is, the chairs are reviewing all escalated issues that have come in so far",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:50): where &quot;escalated issues&quot; means, cases where somebody in the group asked for a change to the spec but the change was rejected",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:51): those are cases that have to be adjudicated by the chairs",

        "ced6bfe1f650f6b338594d37eb7850d2 (05:52): Ah cool",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:52): in this case, it will be significantly longer, though",
        "ced6bfe1f650f6b338594d37eb7850d2 (05:53): reading the mailing list",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (05:53): plus theoritically we never exit a phase, but always enter a new phase. Aka we enter in a phase when all the requirements for entering are met",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (05:53): but that is just semantics",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (05:53): :)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:54): yeah, the phases all just accumulate",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:54): like karmic dust",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:57): anyway, Hixie originally estimated we would go to CR in 2012",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:57): and a lot of people scoffed at that as being too far in the future",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:57): when he said it back in 2006 or early 2007 or so",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (05:58): From prior experience and looking at the development thus far, I'd say that Feb/Mar 2010 sounds about right",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (05:58): (and given the type of specification that people were used to produce aka not a microscopically detailed specification ;) )",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (05:58): 2012*",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (05:58): different expectations",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:59): yeah",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:59): anyway, all the above said, none of these dates really have any effect on end users of the actual technologies",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:59): or on most adopters of the technologies",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:00): I mean on content providers or developers",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:00): what really matters is what has actually been implemented",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:00): and how interoperably it's been implemented",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:00): and how stable it is",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:00): an example is WebSocket",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (06:01): I'm just happy MS is developing IE9 to be compliant with the new spec so developers wont have to waste another decade bickering over the inequities",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:02): yeah, they have done some great stuff so far, as far as getting important features implemented in IE9",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:02): but they have a lot left to do",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:02): everybody does",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:02): an good example is HTML5 forms support",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:02): we still have a long way to go on that",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:03): as far as getting it implemented",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:03): and the example of WebSocket is one where we do already have some solid implementations",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:04): but the spec is not completely stable",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:04): for the protocol part",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (06:04): I'm intrigued to see what roll web-sockets and &lt;canvas&gt; once decently implemented",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:04): and implementations are all going to need to change still",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:05): canvas is probably the most stable new feature from HTML5 that's actually been implemented",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (06:05): I'm not really sold on regular expressions defined in dev source though",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:05): huh?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:05): in what context?",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (06:06): for instance input type=email pattern=&quot;RegEx&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:08): ah",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (06:09): although, i guess that's more of an implementation bit, as it does have valid use for non-security type instances, such as a name or date",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:10): yeah, but I supposed naive developers are certainly going to find ways to do stupid things with it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:10): but that's true of exposing any kind of feature like that to the masses",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:10): svg is more exciting than canvas IMO. once IE supports it, adoption is going to take off",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:11): 3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653: it's not an either-or at all",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:11): sure",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:11): SVG has I think more interesting applications than canvas does",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:11): the market seems to thing they are both pretty exciting",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:11): definitely",
        "e0563cc2e83070e74ce7019226dd654d (06:12): I've not really broken the surface with svg, I was going to do that on my holiday break while traveling",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:12): authoring tool?",

        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:15): you can inspect the javascript drawing on the canvas too.... :)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:15): I'm not sure most JS programmers would agree that code for a canvas-based image/app is more opaque than that for a SVG one",
