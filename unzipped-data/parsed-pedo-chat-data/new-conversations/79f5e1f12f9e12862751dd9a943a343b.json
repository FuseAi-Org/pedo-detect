        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:45): The main UA requirement would be for the UA to be AI-complete, so it can detect sarcasm and allow user stylesheets to highlight it in case the user wasn't reading carefully enough, which shouldn't be that hard",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:45): If browsers developers concentrated all their effort on the AI, then once they've finished they can sit back and the rest of the browser can literally write itself, after pointing it at a few C++ tutorials",
