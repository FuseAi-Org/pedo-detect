I'm Stone Phillips and  \nSpeaker 3    00:00:57    I'm in Curry. Tonight we're back in Texas where police arrested 24 suspected predators and tried to arrest one more suspect who never set foot in our undercover house.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:07    Instead, officers went to his house and their events took a startling and tragic turn. As always, we wanna warn you that some of what you're about to see and hear is explicit. Chris Hansen has our investigation. Affirmative. Yeah, we got a lot of guys due right around. Now, this is hard  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:24    For our latest investigation into online sexual predators. We've come to Murphy, Texas, a bedroom community outside of Dallas. After two days, we're starting to see a trend. Men who make the trip but then seem reluctant to actually come inside our undercover house.",

No.  \nSpeaker 6    00:10:30    No, sir. I like to meet people from all ages. Right? All ages. Doesn't mean that I'm gonna have a sexual encounter with somebody.

No, I would not be able to live consciously knowing that I even touched somebody.  \nSpeaker 1    00:10:57    But here you say that you want to perform oral sex on her. That's touching by the way.

Now turn face right there, sir. Like all the other men who show up at our undercover house, he's taken to the police station where his car is searched. There container investigators read him his rights and begin to question him. Now he remembers the decoy telling her age.  \nSpeaker 12    00:13:08    She didn't seem like she was an underage girl. Okay? But she did say she did tell you that she was 13, right? Right. I don't have any criminal records. I've never, you never checked that. I've never done anything in my life to hurt anybody. Okay? I just found spirituality a few years ago to help me. And I have never done this before.  \nSpeaker 1    00:13:31    But apparently his spirituality didn't stop him from asking for sex with a girl who said she was 13.  \nSpeaker 12    00:13:39    All I can tell you is that you know, you're being charged with a second degree felony. So that means I can go to prison. Yes.  \nSpeaker 1    00:13:46    And there are more men who will be facing the same charge, who admit openly. They think it's no big deal to send pornography to young teens. I sent it to everybody. So it's like your calling card. It's just a picture. When you send it to a 13-year-old girl, it becomes pornography. So what are you thinking? Glad the week's over. Yeah. Long week. Long ass week. Yeah. Think 30 5-year-old Timothy Knowles is here to meet a boy who said he was 13 online calling himself mighty boy. At first he seems careful not to say he wants to have sex, but later using a nickname on Yahoo Tack text, 2005 Brighton Knowles asked the decoy to show his private parts on a webcam. At first he asks to see his chest and stomach there. Hmm. How much more can I see? <laugh> on cam.",

Okay.  \nSpeaker 13    00:24:17    No, I swear.  \nSpeaker 1    00:24:19    The chat continues on and off for two weeks. The assistant district attorney in excess double zero asks the decoy if he likes to kiss and cuddle. The decoy asks what he means in excess. Double zero responds, holding each other, feeling all over later the prosecutor says he'd love to see the boy masturbate.  \nSpeaker 19    00:24:40    So when do you wanna come  \nSpeaker 1    00:24:41    Over? Eventually they talk about meeting in person. You  \nSpeaker 19    00:24:44    Could bring some condoms, maybe you could bring some beer.  \nSpeaker 1    00:24:48    But Conrad never shows up still in the eyes of the law. It makes no difference in Texas. He's already committed a crime. Murphy police chief Billy Myrick explains  \nSpeaker 4    00:25:00    It clearly states in the Texas penal code, that actual contact with the child or an actual meeting does not have to take place  \nSpeaker 1    00:25:07    For a minute, did you say? No, it couldn't be. It's gotta be a mix of Oh yes. It's not gonna be Bill Conrad  \nSpeaker 4    00:25:12    When I just hear that it's the chief felony prosecutor of a neighboring county. Yes, I did. No, it can't be a lot of times and very loudly. I said, let's confirm everything. Let's make sure  \nSpeaker 1    00:25:23    Once the chief is certain he's got the right man, he takes his evidence to a local judge and gets an arrest warrant. He also decides to involve the police in Terrell, the town about 35 miles away where Conrad lives.",

I, you know, it doesn't take an idiot to know that you guys are setting up things. But I wasn't thinking. And I, and to be honest, people say, well, you're thinking about sex.

The district attorney in Rockwell County has been critical of Chief Myrick saying he rushed to make the arrest without consulting him. First.

Since Conrad never came to the house, there's no indication that he knew Dateline was involved.  \nSpeaker 3    00:39:00    Police also went to the homes of several other suspects in this investigation and arrested them. Those men too chatted online with decoys, but never came to the undercover house, will have their stories when we return.  \nSpeaker 1    00:39:24    Dateline's four day investigation here in Murphy, Texas ends shockingly with the suicide of a local prosecutor. Caught chanting sexually online with a decoy back at the station. Police transport the last of the suspects who showed up at our undercover house to the county jail. But it's not the end of this operation for the Murphy Police. You recall, they went to arrest the prosecutor because he didn't show up at the undercover house. Now, the police tracked down three other men who chatted sexually with decoys and who also never came to the house.  \nSpeaker 28    00:40:06    Okay, I'm gonna show you this here.  \nSpeaker 1    00:40:08    27-year-old har under Sing Burke lives right here in Murphy. He admits to police what he said in his chat log was true. He wanted the decoy who said she was 12 to come into his car, give him oral sex, then go.  \nSpeaker 28    00:40:22    Now you know, that's against the law in the state of Texas. Even if you don't meet this girl, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.  \nSpeaker 1    00:40:31    28-year-old Ryan Fritz chatted online with a decoy pretending to be a 14-year-old virgin. He sent a naked picture of himself and asked, would you want to see in person? He also asks the decoy, you want me to teach you sex police? Go to his home and arrest him. He also sees his computer Officer Walter Weiss of the Murphy Police Department made the arrest.  \nSpeaker 9    00:40:56    The family is devastated by what happened.

Is that when you transmitted the picture of you naked wearing a kahan? Yeah. Yes.  \nSpeaker 1    00:41:18    But Fritz says he stopped chatting because his conscience got the best of him. And that's why he says he never showed up at the house.  \nSpeaker 28    00:41:27    I quit talking to whoever it was because it wasn't, I knew that it wasn't  \nSpeaker 1    00:41:32    Right. It turns out this wasn't the only decoy Fritz was chatting with just a few days after his arrest in Murphy. He was caught again chatting with another decoy, an undercover detective in a nearby town posing as a young teen and chief Myrick says that nude picture he sent gave him away.  \nSpeaker 4    00:41:52    He had on a cowboy hat with a very specific headband on it. And when they found that out, that we had copies of those pictures over here. 'cause that was the same kind of pictures they had over there. And they just tied it all together and just made their affirmative link between the two cities then.  \nSpeaker 1    00:42:04    And he wasn't the only one. Caught twice meet 23-year-old James Mars. He chatted online about getting nude and then giving oral sex to a decoy, pretending to be 14 since he didn't show up at our house. Police picked him up at his work and then went to his home to get his computer. His mother let the police in.  \nSpeaker 9    00:42:25    She indicated to me that she didn't know he was doing any of this. And just the look on her face and her demeanor, I'm sure she was shocked and surprised  \nSpeaker 1    00:42:32    When Marsha's brought in for questioning. He tells the officer that he was arrested just five days ago in a different police thing for attempting to meet a young teen at a mall. Okay? He tells the sergeant why he didn't show up at our undercover house.",
