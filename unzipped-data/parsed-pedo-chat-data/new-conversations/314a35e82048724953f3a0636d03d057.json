        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:42): Hi Tyler",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:43): How was the weekend?",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:47): thanks for asking, a real smash :-)",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:47): Lovely!",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:48): c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, had a good time friday playing jazz (autumn leaves, etc... :-) Then went to Berlin on Sunday, still there, we celebrate the 50. anniversity of the European Union over here",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:50): Very nice! Lots of parties and such?",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:50): And Jazz eh? I'm a big fan of the stuff.",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:51): c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, cool, glad you like it",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:51): c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, its quite fun, I tend to move between free music and jazz back and forth over time",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:52): and this very related to what we are doing here",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:52): like sometimes, I really just want to play without thinking too much",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:52): and I end up with funk",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:52): like 2 or 4 chords",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:52): but then, every now and then",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:52): Very nice. :)",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:52): u miss those harmonies",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:53): and u only get them if you thoroughly study jazz standards",
        "52042f566f02d3a63ff64ac064e36cf1 (19:53): None of my mails are on the list :(",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:53): c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, so just a lot like adherend strictly to a declarative spec",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:53): Ah see, I just enjoy listening. :)",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:53): while funk is more like scripting along...",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:54): Hehe",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:54): yeah, jazz standards are quite restrictive",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:54): u need to get those harmonic changes right",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:54): otherwise it dosn't sound nice",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:54): nods.",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:55): whereas e.g. funk is more open and forgiving",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:55): but it can easily end up in a mess then",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:55): especially when playing together with more people",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:56): So then whom would be the version control? ;)",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:57): c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, interesting one...",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:57): in jazz, you have about one or two dozen chords per song",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:57): so when improvising, you get so much room and possibilities, you can stay in the one big version and evolve within in",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:57): with simpler music",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:58): you really need to stop playing and tell the other musicians that something is changing now, otherwise it gets dull, so you need versioning",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:58): of course, you can continue to play and shout at the other musicion a harmonic change",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:58): but thats a hack",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:58): you then yell on stage",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (19:59): WE'RE GOING TO A MINOR NOW, OK?",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (19:59): :)",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (20:00): :-)",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (20:03): I'll be back in a few. Morning stand-up at the office, wee!",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (20:04): 'k, later...",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:05): That would be a good analogy for &lt;svg&gt; and &lt;math&gt; elements. The document shouting &quot;WE'RE GOING TO SVG MODE NOW, OK?&quot; to the parser",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (20:06): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, :-)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:07): And then the parser goes &quot;Eh, A minor? I haven't learned that one yet&quot;",
        "b5f36805a40efe87130ca9a70858457d (20:08): weren't namespaces meant for this?",
