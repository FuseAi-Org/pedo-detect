        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:08): 1k/day storage",
        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:08): gives a good amount of messages really",
        "d83e11907474835badd99f9f8ea1a881 (20:09): Hm ok",
        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:09): might wanna check max cookie sizes but if you just store id's of read messages that would probably work",
        "d83e11907474835badd99f9f8ea1a881 (20:09): ID's only of course :)",
        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:09): when you come to search there though for read messages is the fun bit",
        "d83e11907474835badd99f9f8ea1a881 (20:09): Ok, so this is solved. Now I have in the cookie something like 1654,5564,1548,1354,1879",
        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:10): 4 figure id's??",
        "d83e11907474835badd99f9f8ea1a881 (20:10): Oh, nvm. I think it's ok",
        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:10): i'd have expected at least 10 or so :)",
        "d83e11907474835badd99f9f8ea1a881 (20:10): Well, it's just an example as I said",
        "d83e11907474835badd99f9f8ea1a881 (20:10): I haven't ctually started storing cookies yet",
        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:11): kk",
        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:11): if you parse the content of the cookie back into an array",
        "75a75afe65961688e8423dec6ade51e3 (20:11): would probably be the best way"
