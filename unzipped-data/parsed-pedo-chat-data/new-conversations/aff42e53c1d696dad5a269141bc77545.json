        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (04:06): Hey, I found a bug.  If you go into one of the options, like Max simultaneous downloads, that is numeric and &quot;forces&quot; the input to zero if empty, and you highlight the existing value and type something over it, a zero is appended.  (If it says &quot;2&quot;, and you highlight it and type &quot;3&quot;, you get &quot;30&quot;.)",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (04:08): that's not a bug, that's a linux &quot;feature&quot; ;)",
        "5edf2666a58979476c6c5e0ab19fa662 (04:22): has anyone here worked with tor in conjunction with Azureus",

        "5edf2666a58979476c6c5e0ab19fa662 (04:27): What about setting up encryption for the actual transfers",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (04:27): mort: Why is that a feature?",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (04:28): mort: I understand that the value should be reset to &quot;0&quot; if it's blank, but why can't the correction wait until the control is unfocused, instead of happening on every change to the value?",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (04:30): that's standard gtk behaviour as far as i know, don't ask me why it is this way",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (04:31): tor has nothing to do with encryption, and you are not allowed to route the actual payload through the network",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (04:48): has high priority been purposely tuned to be very close to normal priority in betas? marking files to high priority does not seem to get them finished practically any earlier than normal priority files (even on well seeded &amp; large swarm)",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (04:49): worksforme(tm)",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (04:49): esp. in combination with the &quot;further priorize files....&quot; setting",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (04:50): I'll try with that option enabled",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (04:54): anyway, no wonder that many have mentioned in the forums (ab)using do-not-download priority to get some files first...",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (04:54): yeah, DND should be removed... high, normal, delete....",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (04:55): no!",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (04:55): i need dnd",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (04:55): there is no reason for DND...",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (04:56): you could use delete instead",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (04:56): partial seeding of multifile torrents, i like to set the files to dnd to not to redownload overplapping pieces",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (04:57): delete should preserve overlapping pieces",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (04:57): mort: why would you partially seed it?",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (04:57): mort: if you have all the files, why not seed the whole thing?",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (04:58): The_8472: if i set the files i dont have to delete and the others to dnd, because the first piece of of the first file i have will be downloaded again if i don't do that",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (04:58): [01:56:34] &lt;ttuttle&gt; mort: if you have all the files, why not seed the whole thing? &lt;- because i don't have all the files...",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (04:59): mort, then the bug should be fixed instead of relying on DND",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (05:00): mort: i don't get it.  what triggers the bug?",

        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:02): without dnd i would probably switch clients",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:03): the other problem is if soeone is seeding a nearly identical file (for whatever reason his has a small difference) and you want to help out seeding and keep your file as it is you can simply set it to dnd instead of making a copy just to seed",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (05:04): mort: but if you set it to dnd, won't it have some pieces that fail hash checks?",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:04): yes, and?",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (05:04): mort: isn't that bad?  won't it send the invalid pieces to other clients?",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:05): no",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (05:05): mort: oh",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:05): azureus does not upload bad pieces...where did you get that idea?",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (05:05): mort: i didn't know",
        "2ae294fcd4d447a63309579ba2b4ad81 (05:06): mort: that's why i asked ;-)",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:12): mort, that are rather... constructed scenarios, where the benefit is minimal compared to the damage done by the DND abuse...",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:12): The_8472: those a scenarios i have to deal with",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:13): so DND should at least be moved to advanced user mode",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:13): err... uploading &quot;slightly modified&quot; files with identical length *cough*... how often does that happen in the real world?",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:14): not often but it does",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:14): the partial seeding happens on a regular basis",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:14): ok, and how often do people use DND to download files &quot;in order&quot;?",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:14): as i said... you're using DND to workaround a bug in that case...",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:15): i honestly don't know anyone who uses dnd for that, you could do the same with delete too",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:16): delete every file but one if it's finished set one back to normal....etc",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:17): nah, they download everything and then when the file reaches a high completion they set everything else to DND to download only the remaining pieces of that file",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:17): just have a look at the forums... 2 people mentioning that behavior within days",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:17): and i've seen it quite often in #azureus-support too",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:18): they're even asking to automate it....",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (05:18): maybe that's a problem for the piece distribution on public trackers, i don't care that much then ;)",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (05:19): maybe they wouldn't if the high priority would be more aggressive in getting the prioritized files first :P",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (05:19): though the &quot;further prioritize...&quot; option seemed to help a bit",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:20): &lt;Trewas&gt; maybe they wouldn't if the high priority would be more aggressive &lt;- you mean, would hurt the piece distribution more?",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:21): it's operating on a best-efford basis... and doesn't guarantee anything, but people simply don't get that",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (05:22): I guess there is that point, but in a large&amp;well-seeded swarm a bit less optimal piece distribution does not hurt",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (05:22): so maybe it could take availability etc into account...",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:22): yeah, on a well-seeded swarm the high priority setting already is more aggressive than on low-priority ones",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:22): already is the case",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (05:22): ok",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:23): err..",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:23): low-availability ones",

        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (05:26): in my code the availability based scaling of the rarest piece priority (which ignores high vs. normal) is different",
