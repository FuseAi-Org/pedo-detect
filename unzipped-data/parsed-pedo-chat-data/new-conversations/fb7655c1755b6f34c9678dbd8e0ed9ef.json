        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (02:22): assuming the tests would fail now..",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:24): 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: I hadn't thought about it - I don't know if the spec has any mechanism for feature detection",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:25): in any case feature tests would currently pass, even though our implementations are pretty crufty",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:25): checking the value of input.type should work iirc",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:25): iirc it'll be &quot;text&quot; if the type isn't supported at all",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (02:25): yeah.. basic approachis to check value of input.type and see if it isn't 'text' .. chrome loves to false positive with that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:25): yeah that's the problem with feature tests :-)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:25): I believe both Chrome and Safari will claim to support almost all the types by that standard",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:26): which in a sense we do, but perhaps not in a way you would actually want to use",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:26): using cutting edge feature is fraught with such difficulties",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (02:26): so i've been throwing text like ':)' into the value of input type=&quot;date&quot; and reading it out.. assuming that a proper date input would only allow proper date input..  that's seemed to work so far",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:26): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: i was sad to see the incomplete implementations ship, didn't expect that",
