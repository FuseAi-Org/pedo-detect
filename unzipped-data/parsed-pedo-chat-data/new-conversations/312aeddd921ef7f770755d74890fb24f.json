        "2da63e5dfcceb77803fafe2cc0b64213 (02:20): is it possible during the installation of 10.1 to use this area of the drive in a filesystem and have the FS understand that it really shouldn't try to use the blocks in question?",
        "2da63e5dfcceb77803fafe2cc0b64213 (02:20): realizing of course that I do not intend to use said area of the drive for anything that I would deem to be important, by the way...",
        "5b61d2cc0223d1497173cb5ab988ef5b (02:21): ramz, if bad blocks are showing up when the drive is being checked, back up anything on it you want to keep, because it's not long for this world.  it has already used up all the spare blocks set aside for replacement.",

        "2da63e5dfcceb77803fafe2cc0b64213 (02:22): sjones: honestly I haven't even checked the drive... heh... I just noticed that in the past when the system was writing to a particular part of the drive that I would get a bunch of I/O errors in syslog... I assumed these to be bad blocks...",

        "5b61d2cc0223d1497173cb5ab988ef5b (02:23): ramz, I would use the drive manufacturer's diagnostic tools to detemine whether or not they are truly bad, then.",

        "2da63e5dfcceb77803fafe2cc0b64213 (02:25): sphenxes: hmm... then NFS might be a better option, though there's no real reason why you couldn't set up samba shares between 2 linux boxes... and it's a helluva lot easier to set up than NFS... any thoughts from the gallery?",

        "2da63e5dfcceb77803fafe2cc0b64213 (02:26): sphenxes: yes, scp, specifically... but that would be more geared towards one-off transfers",
