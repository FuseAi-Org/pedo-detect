        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (14:50): so having a keyword that says &quot;this is *not* resolved, although Bugzilla says it is&quot; would be helpful",
        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (14:50): tada",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:50): I just do not think it is to the benefit of any of us to allow editorial bugs to spiral into becoming Issues",
        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (14:51): yes, that's why I didn't so far",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:53): since others seem to be hung up on that word also",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:53): but adding a new state adds that state globally in bugzilla",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:53): so that affects all W3C users of bugzilla, across all WGs",
