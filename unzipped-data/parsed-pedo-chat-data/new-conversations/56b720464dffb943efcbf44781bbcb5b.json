        "189edbf28f3da1f5bf29efe53c42687b (16:38): the event is onload not onLoad",

        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:48): Raevel, this makes no difference...",
        "4fdcbc807f1c910ab5e7458d0ca8c80b (16:48): why not? they prefer a unfriendly world?",
        "4fdcbc807f1c910ab5e7458d0ca8c80b (16:48): :-)",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:48): Raevel, neither the window.onload or the document.body.onloads are being fired",
        "189edbf28f3da1f5bf29efe53c42687b (16:49): Pandect can you reproduce it? i have never ever had any issue like that",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:49): Raevel, Yes, on my system, the page I am working on reproduces it very consistently",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:49): IE every refresh :)",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (16:49): I had that once. Turned out that I had forgotten to re-enable javascript",
        "189edbf28f3da1f5bf29efe53c42687b (16:49): sounds like a winner&lt;3",

        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:50): here's the thing",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:50): I can place a &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; alert(1); &lt;/script&gt; right before the close of the &lt;/body&gt; tag, and that gets fired",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:51): even weirded, without the alert, the onload does not get fired, and with the alert, the onload gets fired",
        "189edbf28f3da1f5bf29efe53c42687b (16:51): Pandect i say strip it down, paste online",

        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:52): Well, the total javascript I have on this page is ~1000 lines",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:52): that would be quite difficult for anybody to go through :)",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:52): i mean just generally though, is it possible that a javascript error could cause onload not to fire?",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (16:52): yes",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:52): ok... how about if I have javascript debugging set to 'on', and i don't see any errors?",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:53): (normally, when I see errors, it offers a friendly debug option, and pops up a window)",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:53): is it possible that there is still an error that it's just not showing me, that causes onload not to fire?",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:55): ok so how about this, it's getting stranger...",
        "afdb8a11ec2dba4258acc7530974a39b (16:55): I just commented out ALL javascript on the page, and i'm still not getting the onload to fire",
        "189edbf28f3da1f5bf29efe53c42687b (16:56): it's impossible for us to help you further without the code, and if it is 1000 lines, that's why you should strip it",
        "189edbf28f3da1f5bf29efe53c42687b (16:56): you will probably find the problem yourself i you do that",
        "e056bdb9e726d03a298a18ef0fcb6ead (17:04): does createTextNode() behave correctly in IE ? I'm adding text dynamically, in firefox the text is shown, in IE I see nothing, however when I copy the innerHTML from the main div to another place, I can see all the created textnode.",
        "189edbf28f3da1f5bf29efe53c42687b (17:05): can't think of any instance where it didnt work",

        "e056bdb9e726d03a298a18ef0fcb6ead (17:08): strange thing however is, when I disable css in de IE developer toolbar, I still see no content, but when I copy the innerHTML of the containing div, and do document.write() the alle nodes become visible.",
