        "a20e0580519fa0e9092d058a67627726 (00:31): the url is computed by the authentication engine and contains variable parameters. Is there any way to work around the validation error and still maintain a &quot;post to current url&quot; behavior?",

        "a20e0580519fa0e9092d058a67627726 (00:49): why in the sky was this constraint introduced?",

        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (00:55): yes, when you want to break out of the default model for how HTML works, any recommendation I do involving &quot;write some JS&quot; is pretty serious =)",
        "a20e0580519fa0e9092d058a67627726 (00:55): I think W3C has to revise that constraint, or introduce a conventional representative for &quot;current URI&quot;",

        "a20e0580519fa0e9092d058a67627726 (00:57): I think it's great that you have thorough and dedicated. And I think this constraint is short sighted",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (00:58): think of it this way: arguments are not HTML",

        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (00:59): it's your responsibility.",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (00:59): if you're using PHP or something to accept those arguments, then you get to write the code to inject them into the form that gets generates for that page.",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (00:59): it's pretty simple that way",

        "a20e0580519fa0e9092d058a67627726 (01:00): it has nothing to do with the page's own content, yet it needs to be passed on",

        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (01:00): so that's where you make the magic happen.",

I've done some logging and the the code appears to be getting the 2d context. Any have any ideas?",

But building dynamically appears to be the issue, i thought it was a timing problem, but the context is available when I draw - and all elements have been appended to the dom - going strip code out I think, has to be something silly",
