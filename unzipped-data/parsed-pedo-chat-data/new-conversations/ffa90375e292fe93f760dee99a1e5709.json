        "c199587fec60370a7b74a190986f7b6f (02:12): i thought it had something to do with setting position: relative",
        "b896c09b0788e305fdc746085853a996 (02:13): as long as you don't apply a specific  size to the div inside,",

        "b896c09b0788e305fdc746085853a996 (02:14): It can become a scrollbar box,",
