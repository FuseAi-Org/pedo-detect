        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (12:28): though perhaps that's a good way to get the fix verified by the reporter",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:39): lordy, now b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 is suggesting that whatwg.org use a CDN. :-P",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:43): I learned all the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0/1.1 DOCTYPEs. It's not that hard, since the follow a common pattern",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:46): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: so to make the cost entirely borne by the RDF community, you'd need a way to make the RDF community to pay the CDN bill",
