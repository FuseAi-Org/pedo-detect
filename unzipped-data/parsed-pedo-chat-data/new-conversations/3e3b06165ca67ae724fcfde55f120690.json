        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:20): does someone maintain a summary of Web Socket changes since -75?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:22): -75?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:22): cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: what was the last one that was basically Hixie's creation?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:23): was it -76?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:23): yeah",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:23): I can't remember how much IETFness was in 76 vs. 75",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:23): actually hixie's latest is called &quot;-latest&quot; and didn't go into ietf",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:23): -latest sounds more Living than numbered snapshots :-)",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:24): which had changed framing and a few other fixes (subprotocol negotiation comes to mind)",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:24): but -76 was what got implemented, basically",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:24): ok, so is there a summary of the delta between -76 and whatever it is that's being implemented now?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:25): (opera has a few things from -latest that we had whined about and implemented before hixie got around to fixing the spec)",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:25): not that i'm aware of",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:25): i would summarize it as follows: everything is changed",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:26): cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: ok. thanks.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (17:26): That's what I was going to say :)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (17:26): It is basically unrecognisable",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:26): cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: did the IETF add or remove features in addition to changing how the old features mapped to bits on the wire?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:27): added &quot;extensibility&quot;, binary support, compression support",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:27): actually i don't recall the state of compression",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:27): might be taken out currently",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:28): also made lots of details undefined",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:29): like error handling",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:29): see http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg07063.html",

        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:33): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: and there's a header to enable the extension or something",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:33): although extensions do not need to use the reserved bits (e.g. compression doesn't)",

        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:35): more or less",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:40): reminds me that i still need to review the newest spec changes",

        "9dfea2f9bd9114520591dceb20d528a1 (18:38): So the plan is just to hope it doesn't run too wild? :)",

        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (18:44): or removing it"
