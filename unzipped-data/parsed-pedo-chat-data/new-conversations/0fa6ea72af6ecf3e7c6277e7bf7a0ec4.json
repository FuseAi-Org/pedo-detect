        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (03:28): nope",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (03:52): How can I test if an object is disposed allready?",
        "21a889a1ac9c02d0bdd8f39fe745a582 (03:53): Remi_Woler: The author of the class needs to add support for a test property such as .IsDisposed, otherwise you can't",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (03:53): But, you could only find out if the property exists using a try{ } block, right?",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (03:54): cause if the object is allready disposed, the property isn't accessible either",

        "47b859253f9684758f59852b31e91d71 (03:56): Disposed doesnt mean it's collected by the GC",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (03:57): well, the app trowed an exception saying that the object was allready disposed, when I tried to call one of it's methods",
        "47b859253f9684758f59852b31e91d71 (03:57): that can happen yes, but that's the object itself which implements that behavior",
        "47b859253f9684758f59852b31e91d71 (03:57): usually these kind of objects have an IsDisposed-kind of property though",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (03:58): I solved it by calling the method somewhere else, but I'm going to see if it exists :)",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (03:58): wilco: you're right, it has",
        "47b859253f9684758f59852b31e91d71 (03:59): then you should be able to safely call it",
        "47b859253f9684758f59852b31e91d71 (03:59): no need to catch anything",

        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (04:00): only when you close the app?",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (04:00): its happens under cirtain conditions ... theres lots of articles around on how it works",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (04:01): heh, nm then :)",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (04:01): its worth reading into so you have an idea of what goes on ... its always good to know whats hapopening behind the scenes and its not too complex",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (04:02): I know how it works. Was just wondering when it was activated.",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (04:02): is the object your checking for most likely to be generation 1, 2 or 3?",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (04:03): but tbh: one of the first things i needed to find out is to learn to develop with an active GC. I was so used to unset() a variable after using it",
        "a13ddc4c0c75b10b8ec493f64dbff1c4 (04:03): dunno. It's a form :)",

        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (04:28): ASP isn't a language",

        "7c5c36166817f6b43786a3f1ae9750f7 (05:01): What can be the problem if a class just doesn't see the namespace of another form?",
        "7c5c36166817f6b43786a3f1ae9750f7 (05:04): I have a class that handles all the mysql connections, so I can perform a query with 2 lines of code. I want to show a form from within that class, if the connection settings are not working. But it just won't see the formname class. Every other class does, except this one",
        "7c5c36166817f6b43786a3f1ae9750f7 (05:06): nm, forgot to define the namespace on the mysql class.",

        "f662b89023236dd10dc4434c3fed3330 (05:13): heh, the way I did it (in Suroden, a C# mud hack at every once and a while) I made a generic Command class and made each of the commands (i.e. QuitCommand, etc) derive from that",
        "f662b89023236dd10dc4434c3fed3330 (05:13): then I did a list of all the commands and you do a lookup by the command verb",

        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:19): ofc, but if you\u00a5ve never implemented such a protocol it takes some time to understand everything",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:20): and i didn\u00a5t know all the messages getting exchanged while communicating",

        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:21): there exist lots of code but none suits completely my needs and without the necessary knowledge of the protocol it\u00a5s difficult to extend them",
        "f662b89023236dd10dc4434c3fed3330 (05:22): ah",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:22): so i try to learn it by implementing it on my own (also can\u00a5t be a that bad excercise :) )",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (05:22): what exactly are you doing with SSL that's so rough and tough?",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:22): nothing fancy, i just need dhe/dss-support and session resuming",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (05:22): there's probably a good reason session resuming doesn't exist as part of the spec... insecurity",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (05:23): dunno about the D/H exchange, I thought you could already do that",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:23): but unfortunately the rfc for ftps specifies it",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (05:23): SFTP? or FTPS?",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:23): ftps",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (05:23): bleh, FTPS is a piece of shit... use SFTP",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:24): i\u00a5m bound to ftps",

        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:25): it\u00a5s a hobby-job and i have to stick to established structures",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:25): btw: why is ftps a piece of shit?",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (05:25): because FTP is a piece of shit",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (05:26): ok, the definition is old, but it still does its job",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (05:26): no, FTP itself is a rather large piece of shit... FTPS just encrypts the packets",
        "f662b89023236dd10dc4434c3fed3330 (05:28): sftp opens an ssh connection and tunnels ftp through it, correct?",
