        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:29): (The 8 are the fault of the preprocessor.)",

The way it's written, only a whitelist of &lt;image&gt; types are allowed in the final fallback, which means we'll have to keep it updated.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:45): I'd rather just say &quot;&lt;color&gt; | &lt;image&gt;&quot;, and then disallow image() in the prose.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:46): It's also too restrictive - the way you rewrote it, &lt;image-combination&gt; isn't allowed, even if there's no reference to image() in the arguments to cross-fade().",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:50): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: why wouldn't you just cross-fade(image(),image()) in that case?",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:51): I'm not saying you wouldn't.  I'm saying that as it's written, you can't do an image(&quot;foo&quot;, cross-fade(url(&quot;bar&quot;), blue, 50%)) or something.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:51): is that useful?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:52): It's not clearly useless, and I don't think there's any simplicity benefits from disallowing it.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:53): I'd ask dbaron on that",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:54): Well, I'll say that you don't gain anything from disallowing that while allowing, say, nested cross-fade()s.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:54): we allow nested cross-fade()s?",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:54): Sure.  An image is an image.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:54): It lets you fade three images together.",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:56): If it's easy, fine",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:56): if it's extra work, I'd like to keep nesting out of this level",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:56): it's definitely more complicated to test",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:56): Other than the fact that more image manipulation = more CPU load, there's no problem from doing so.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:56): Sure.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:56): It's definitely possible to extend in that direction in the future",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:57): But if we disallow nested cross-fades, you can still, say, filter() a cross-fade(), or vice versa, which is roughly equivalent in difficulty.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:57): so I'm kindof biased towards not allowing nesting",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:57): I'm biased toward not putting in artificial restrictions just because it makes testing more difficult.",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:58): doesn't see filter() in this draft",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:58): We'd have to invent a notion of a &lt;plain-image&gt; versus &lt;constructed-image&gt; or something, and only allow some functions to take &lt;plain-image&gt; as arguments.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:58): No, filter() will be in Filters.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:58): good",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:05): the last is only there to provide enough contrast in case stuff fails",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:05): That's silly.  Then I can't fall back to a gradient, for example.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:06): you're already in a failure mode if your images don't load",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:06): if you can fall back to a gradient, then why not fall back to a full &lt;background&gt; declaration",
