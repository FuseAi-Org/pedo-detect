        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:54): 041f18d4e2e27cd97f4404c2c67cb362: Firefox needs to do more comparisons to clamp to 0-255, too",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:55): 041f18d4e2e27cd97f4404c2c67cb362: There's broken character encoding on benchmark.html :-p",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:56): Also, that does look like a problem",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (13:57): Hixie: hmm, why w3c version only? i think more people &quot;don't read&quot; the whatwg version",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:09): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fphilip.html5.org%2Fdemos%2Fcanvas%2F3d%2Fx3d%2Ftest.xhtml&amp;charset=&amp;nsfilter=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.web3d.org%2Fspecifications%2Fx3d-namespace",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:09): enjoy the creeping featurism :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:15): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Looks good :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:16): though could the &quot;Namespace Filter&quot; words be made non-breakingly-spaced, since there's plenty of horizontal room on the screen and it looks a little inconsistent when it's wrapped?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (14:18): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: now we're talking :D",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:20): Hixie, is the prize for the acid3 competition simply being attributed in the comments in the file?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:20): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Would it be sensible to emit a warning/comment that there is some filtered-namespace content and it isn't being validated and so the document may not be valid?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:22): Also, it's not clear that this doesn't affect the text/html parser if you try to filter the HTML namespace",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:25): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Why is http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fphilip.html5.org%2Ftests%2Fcanvas%2Fsuite%2Ftests%2Fresults.html (number of &lt;col&gt; != number of columns) an error?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:25): for something that only needs a URI the UI of the validator is becoming increasingly complex",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:26): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: Use http://html5.validator.nu/ if you want to avoid the complexity of XML :-)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:27): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yeah, the length of &quot;Namespace Filter&quot; is a problem. I have to try out different options with that one",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:28): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: presumably you'd put stuff in the filter field in order to suppress messages, so a warning wouldn't be very productive. Could be argued either way, though.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:29): btw, there might be a bug with the automatic schema selection mechanism and the namespace filter. need to debug :-(",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (14:29): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: the encoding override emits a warning... i'd expect namespace override to emit a warning as well",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:29): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I can't recall if the col thing is based on HTML 4, WHATWG list email from Hixie or my own judgment",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (14:30): otherwise it's easy to fool people that a document validates when they're not paying attention to the URL",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:30): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: http://html5.validator.nu/ has simple UI. for the generic case, people want to be able to do stuff while others want simplicity. UI design is hard.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:31): People could put &quot;Valid XHTML5!&quot; buttons on their web page, linking to the validator with nsfilter=http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:31): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: in any case, you can paste a URI in the Document field and hit return and get sensible defaults",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:32): schema override doesn't warn though",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:32): by design",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (14:32): that's fine :)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:33): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: not that on the HTML5 side, encoding override and ns filter are subtle :-)",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:34): hmm, I'd think html5.validator.nu should be on validator.nu and what's now on validator.nu should be on advanced or complex.validator.nu",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:34): but nevermind",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:35): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: at least I should make links between them",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:36): in the end i'd want this validator to be on w3.org but that may be hard :)",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:36): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: actually, there's also the XML namespace",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:37): Ah",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:37): Still doesn't sound like anyone would have a valid reason to filter namespaces from text/html, though",
