        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:03): Or to put it another way, &quot;These topics have been discussed at great length already, and it's not likely that whatever you might have to say about it is going change the worlds and magically bring everything to a resolution&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:04): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 - yeah",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:05): can create your own perfect authoring language that exactly meets whatever criteria you have",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:06): and then try to convince others to use that for authoring if you want",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:06): but it does not need to be directly supported in browsers",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:08): reads cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 message on document.title",

        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (13:13): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: right",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (13:14): my proposal doesn't either, but is closer",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:15): it's great to be getting these detailed spec reviews posted to public-html",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:16): I think a side effect of it'l be to try to set higher expectations about what't appropriate for the list",

        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (13:19): and encourage others to do detailed reviews",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:20): I think at some point we need to take a hard look at what has actually been accomplished by having a W3C working group participating in work on the HTML5 spec that might not have been accomplished by having the discussion take place only on the WHATWG list",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:21): but not sure what we can point to so far as far as that goes",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:23): I think another anticipated benefit of having discussion within a W3C context was that it would facilitate and encourage participation from Microsoft ...",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:25): currently at 1212 tests for #numbers",

        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (13:27): that doesn't mean we will have complete implementations though",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:27): (which massively increases the amount of invalid input, and checking of the error handling)",
