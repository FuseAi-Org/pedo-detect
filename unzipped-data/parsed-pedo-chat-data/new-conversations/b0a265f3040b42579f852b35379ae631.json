        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:35): yup",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:35): I am working on an application where I so far have about 400kb of uncompressed js",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:35): When removing comments and unneeded whitespace I get to about 200kb",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:36): if I pack that I get about 150kb",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:36): if I gzip that it gets down to a lot less",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:36): definately under the pain limit",
        "62fba5811243f518935848d952809f8c (12:37): Now, what's the size difference between gz and (-comments)+pack+gz?",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:38): I havent measured it yet since we arent anywhere close to releasing it yet",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:39): It cant be much",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:39): but the comments removal and packing is mainly because the boss is paranoid and hasnt understood that basicly you cant hide javascript",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:40): I dont care as long as I can just make those things part of my normal buildscript",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:41): What about using Dean Edwards's packer?",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:41): I do",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:41): Ah.",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:41): The perl version",

        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:42): For size yes. Other than that I dont see the point",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:42): People who can understand the code are good enough to be able to come up with it themselves",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:42): Especially for large applications where everything is bound together in wierd ways",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:42): Are you talking about obfuscation?",

        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:43): yes. The boss wants the packer because of the obfuscating ability",

        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:43): Not that anyone cant just unpack it",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:43): No, of course not.  That would be unthinkable... 8-)",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:43): And I really dont care to make a real obfuscator",

        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:44): indeed",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:44): It's like the encryption on DVDs... you have to hand the end-user the key, the lock and what you've locked.",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:45): But the ood thing about JS is that the people who are able to break the encryption, dont need to",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:45): Locked away, perhaps.",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:45): True.",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:45): They can much more easily reverse engineer it",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:45): And in the process adapt it to their needs",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:45): munter: the reason i was asking is that the prototype and scriptaculous libs seem fairly large",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:46): wyrd33: They are. Cut down on the parts you don tuse",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:46): Or use jQuery.",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:46): jquery?",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:46): <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">http://jquery.com/</a>",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:46): Its just yet another abstraction layer",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:46): It's a different library altogether with the primary goal being able to pack as much as they can in as little space (around 10K) as possible.",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:47): I prefer do code in javascript, not in jQuery, scripaculous or whatever they are all called",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:47): I'm not getting into which one is &quot;better&quot;, since that's a stupid argument anyway, but jQuery is certainly smaller (and probably has proportionately fewer features).",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:47): ah.. im more or less looking for effects though",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:47): in 10k i can do a LOT of stuff",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:47): moo.fx looks pretty good for only 3k, and they have &quot;prototype.lite&quot; which is also 4k",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:48): Munter: Go ahead, no one's stopping you. :-)",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:49): How about a tree menu in ~20 lines? How much space would that take with any of thos libs?",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:49): *shrugs* im just starting to familiarize myself with them, but creating drag and drop between two menus (lists) is two lines of code with scriptaculous",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:50): correct, that takes a bit more if you do it yourself",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:50): yeah",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:51): However i did it anyway, because I had to do drag/drop across frames",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:51): browsers do cache the javascript files though, right?",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:51): They do",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:51): As long as they're regular .js files, yes.",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:52): so if you have gzip enabled with your CMS or your own homebrew php framework (or lang of choice), it should decrease the size even further, right?",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:53): yes",
        "a06799ba5c7fbc1cd9f0fe0c683c6ee2 (12:53): Yuh.",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:54): so 150kish is acceptable then? im still trying to get a feel of what the standard is",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:56): That depends on your audience and their expectations",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:56): 150kb is not acceptable for a website imo",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:56): hmm, i see",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:57): all the frameworks i've looked at with capabilities such as drag and drop are fairly large",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:57): However, for some type of application, where the user possible gets a loading screen or something like it, it might look different",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:57): Thats because those frmeworks tend to come with the kitchen sink",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:57): Just cut them",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:57): unless some license prevents you from it",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:58): well, for the drag and drop stuff it'd be more or less for an admin menu",
        "5ca5a0a9116c74005c4a7781670de639 (12:58): looking at scriptaculous drag and drop .. it depends on their effects.js, which is another 30k. so splitting those scripts obviously wont happen",
