        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:47): Hmm, the &lt;svg xmlns=foo&gt; things the second time you use it on a page",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:47): Uh",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:47): s/things/thing works/",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:49): ...but when I say &quot;works&quot;, I mean that in basically the opposite sense to usual, because it breaks the parsing of everything after the second usage",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): i really am very disappointed in their insistence on continuing this xmlns= crap in text/html",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): the more they do with this, the more screwed we are in html5 in terms of adding namespaces",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): though maybe we can just do ns= or something",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (01:59): htmlns",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:59): The more annoying thing is how simply using colons (with no xmlns or anything) causes occasional XML-like parsing",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:00): well that's ok",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:00): don't use colons :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:00): we've already learnt (the hard way) that prefixes are a horrible idea",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:00): so whatever we do end up doing won't have prefixes",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (02:04): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, could you please document how you've learned that prefixes are a horrible idea so others won't keep repeating and reproposing that mistake?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:05): yeah i have a half-written blog post on the subject",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:05): i add to it occasionally",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:05): one day it'll even get finished :-)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:06): And then someone will point out how all the problems are really just awesome features that we aren't ready to leverage yet",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:06): yup",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:06): but we don't have to agree with them",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:07): I'm just wondering if there are any people left who don't either know or don't want to know :)",

        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:32): I shall forget I ever had concerns about that part, for now :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:35): wait, the spec already seems to be updated",

        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:42): I'm guessing the &quot;other source&quot; is, e.g., stuff typed in the location bar",
