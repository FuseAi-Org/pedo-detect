        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:26): note that the hybi group has basically totally revamped the protocol, so it's kind of a moot point now",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:26): as the protocol is nothing like it was then",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (02:26): well, the way it reads on their site it's like they are claiming to have invented the protocol as it is at present",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (02:27): but there's really a heap more people who have contributed to it",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:28): as i understand it there are three realistic handshake designs: tls-only, the one i designed based on mcarter's design, and abarth's design",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:28): but i'm not really following the work closely, so don't take my word for it",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:32): and therefore not realistic",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:32): the one with the eight bytes is still secure according to abarth (i spoke to him just earlier today about it)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:33): (which we knew wasn't secure; the 8 bytes were mitigation for that)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:35): however, I still think it is less robust against a variety of threat models than the adam+eric proposal",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:36): well i am not advocating it one way or the other",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:41): its security against this intercepting proxy attack depends completely on whether the 8 random bytes break the ability to get intercepting proxies to see subsequent data on the connection as new requests",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:42): (something that Adam et al didn't test but probably should have)",

But indeed, we don't know without testing.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:48): It's academic, anyway, since the group isn't going to use this handshake.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:48): well, it's still the handshake in current drafts",
