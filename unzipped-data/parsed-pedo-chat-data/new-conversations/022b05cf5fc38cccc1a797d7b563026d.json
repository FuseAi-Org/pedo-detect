        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (16:09): ok. Noone can help you with the current level of information, so have fun",
        "e38b2d0a55ca7f00564f3a85ff33d75a (16:10): Munter, why is it people in channels like this, specifically ones like you, think for some reason they get to act like pricks for any reason they can",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (16:11): i am not acting like anything",

        "e38b2d0a55ca7f00564f3a85ff33d75a (16:12): You kno whow most people would answer that, they would say something along the lines of &quot;Could you give a link to the problem&quot; or &quot;If you give a link I might be able to help&quot; not a snide remark like you made",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (16:12): You may of course not follow this advice, and instead wait for someone eager to drag every bit of information out of you themselves",

        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (16:14): But if you'd like I can just shut up",

        "4e96fd19b7450b0fe822449638fe1499 (16:48): phretor: At the moment, no. I'm hampered by the fact that (despite having moved in almost two months ago) I don't have a phone line running into my flat yet, so don't have an internet connection and so don't have anywhere to host my site. :)",
        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (16:48): DRMacIver: OMG, what a bad situation you are into",
