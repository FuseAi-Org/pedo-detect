        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (23:47): i would expect step 1 of http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/timers.html#get-the-timed-task to do it",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (23:47): or possibly step 10 of http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/timers.html#list-of-active-timeouts",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (23:47): but i don't see it",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (23:47): (my real motive here is to figure out how to spec similar behavior in the RAF spec)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:48): um",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:49): it would appear that not only is the task never removed from the list of active timeouts",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:49): but that the task's presence on the list of active timeouts has no effect",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:49): that's embarassing",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (23:49): it's used for lookups in cleartimeout()",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (23:49): if nothing matching that ID is in the list of active timeouts, clearTimeout() does nothing",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (23:49): ok i guess i won't cargo cult this particular mechanism :)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:50): yeah, it seems clearTimeout() as specced does nothing black-box detectable",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:50): &quot;oops&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:50): there should be a step before step 10 that checks if the task is still in the list",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:50): and if not aborts",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:53): edit it back",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:07): it's an auxiliary one iirc",

        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (00:08): just want to verify that top level browsing contexts are 1:1 with window/tabs",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:10): top level browsing contexts are 1:1 with window/tabs to a first approximation",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:10): there have been browsers with multiple top-level browsing contexts per window, e.g. in sidebars",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (00:11): right. they're separate enough for my concerns here, i think",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (00:11): i think chromium extension popups are also their own top-level browsing contexts",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:12): modulo sandboxing, a top-level browsing context is one where window.top===window",
