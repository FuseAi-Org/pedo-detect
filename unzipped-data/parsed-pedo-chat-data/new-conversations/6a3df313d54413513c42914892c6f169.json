        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:19): (...with the same instance)",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:20): yes",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:20): its called a standby database",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:20): or, you can have them clustered",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:20): so both can work side by side",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:20): although god knows what happens in that situation when one goes down ! :)",
        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:21): we are talking about two seperated machines.. right?",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:21): yes",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:21): yes and no",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:21): well you could have a standy database on the same server",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:21): you can run both rac and dataguard on one machine.. but it is unsupported by oracle and sort of contradicts itself",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:21): but whats the point?",
        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:22): the point is... the server crashes.. what do we do?",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:24): startup your standby database on another server",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:24): change connection settings for clients, and your away",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:25): how does that sound?",

        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:26): but its expensive, you can frig Oracle standard edition so that you can have a standby database, without having to use dataguard",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:26): but you have to write the scripts to copy the archive redo logs and apply them",
        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:26): money its not problem",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:27): the only real point of dataguard on one machine is if you two storage systems and want to cater for data corruption..",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:28): you have*",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:28): but how often do you get that these days?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:28): it's not like you have tablespaces on tape ;)",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:28): ok but.... say the hardware of the servers dies",

        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:30): true :)",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:30): so maybe dataguard and another machine is the way to go for kRocKodile? if he says money is no option",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:34): if money is no problem i'd suggest a pair of x4600's .. one on the rack next to the current db ... and one at a DR site 20 miles away :)",
        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:34): the code of erp must be written to support standby server?",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:36): depending on your config you can either use a ip transfer or simple reconfigure the erp jdbc connection when you need to do a failover/switchover",
        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:37): what x4600 is?",
        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:38): sun?",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:38): hehe",

        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:39): maybe even create the DR site so that it looks exactly like your current site, so when you move, all workers will feel right at home, and will soon forget the disaster",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:40): if money is no option",

        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:42): but i allready have one oracle licence",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:42): you don't need a license for a standby servers",
        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:43): in this case 45k goes all for hardware",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:43): remember that dataguard requires enterprise edition... or you can as English` said do your own &quot;poor mans dataguard&quot; with scripts ... usually simpler",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:43): ok",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:43): what do you prefer, sun/amd/xeon solaris/linux?",

        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:44): yes, we use that, and in fact we used the standby in the end to move from a Physical server to the vmware'd standby server, everything went fine",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (15:44): English`: in a way i almost prefer the scripted way... it leaves less &quot;gotchas&quot; to oracle... keeps things simple",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:45): :)",
        "e20ed8096d47afda16203435da629ea3 (15:45): so what this script do? copy the files of instance?",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:46): copy accross archive redo logs, and then applies them to standby",

        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:46): why?",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:46): of course it depends on your script, how intelligent you make it",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (15:47): to recover from network issues etc",
