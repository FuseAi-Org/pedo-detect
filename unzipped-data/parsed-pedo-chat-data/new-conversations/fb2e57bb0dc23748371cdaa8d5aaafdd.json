        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:13): and while those calls should work, i think for the purpose of demonstrating the particular dom interfaces being tested, it'd be good to go the iframe route",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:13): yeah, that's a bug",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:13): i.e., could you include an &lt;iframe&gt; with an empty svg document?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:13): i think you misunderstand how acid tests work :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:13): the more broken things you rely on for the test, the better :-)",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:13): heh",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:14): so you'd rather a submission like that then?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:14): sure",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:14): ok then",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:14): i can always tweak it later if necessary",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:14): righto",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:15): (btw doug's gonna coordinate a few tests from us svg guys and send them in to you)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:15): it's so sad, i've received very few acid3 test submissions, and most of those that i have received have fundamentally missed at least one of the rules",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:15): hmm",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:15): (different rules each time)",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:16): do you have enough for the 10 at least? :)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:16): not even close",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:16): (and it's 16 :-( )",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:16): ah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:16): someone submitted 11 tests... for XMLHttpRequest",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:16): which isn't even in LC yet",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:16): :(",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:16): let alone CR in 2004",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:17): i didn't have much time during the week, so i've really only been working on it the last few days",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:17): so just one test from me",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:17): every little bit helps :-)",
        "f109a63709e702ed304a85e971b0f710 (12:17): enjoys tests involving non plane 0 characters",

        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:31): thought the numbering stable enough to remove the note from &lt;http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pNgBCwWdyRTT2JeiZn4B2Yw&gt;",
        "162922e135c0af768927f1a6c966d3a9 (12:31): I'm asking because I wonder whether it makes sense to refer to tests by number right now (when talking to other developers, noting down info)",
