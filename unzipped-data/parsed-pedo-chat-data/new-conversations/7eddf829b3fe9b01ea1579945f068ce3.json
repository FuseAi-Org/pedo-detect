        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:45): sure",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:45): we just passed r3600",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:47): If you'd worked faster and done one commit per second, it would only have taken an hour to reach this far instead of five years",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:47): Now that's a useful fact",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:47): actually the repo started in like 2006 or 2007 or something",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:53): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: i think you understand them -- we just want to be able to have well-defined conformance criteria for authors that are sane (no radiobutton checkboxes or headers that aren't headers or whatnot), and well defined conformance criteria for implementations when the author ones are ignored.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:54): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: let me ask you about one hypothetical",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:56): conformance checkers were allowed to flag the checked/aria-checked conflict as nonconforming, and specs were allowed to specifically define cases as nonconforming, and &quot;native&quot; state is defined to take precedence for implementations",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:56): would it be important to have the same for role, so that for example &lt;input type=&quot;radiobutton&quot; role=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked&gt; can be disallowed by the host language?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:56): I think your answer will be that, yes, conflicting roles should be disallowed even if no other state is conflicting",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:56): i think that's important, yes",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:57): and i'd like to make any such contradictions have crystal clear implementation requirements, ideally requirements that cause the visual semantics to be propagated to the AT even if the aria semantics would contradict the visual semantics",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:58): i.e. native semantics should win (i think that would lead to more accessible pages)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:58): I'm assuming that &lt;div&gt;, for example, would have null intrinsic semantics and thus be compatible with any ARIA role",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:01): for example, they have an example of giving &lt;li&gt; a menuitem role, which seems reasonable since lists are often used as menus (whether pop-up or static)",
