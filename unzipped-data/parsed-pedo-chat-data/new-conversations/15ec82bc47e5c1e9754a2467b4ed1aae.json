        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:08): i was getting abrupt system shutdowns under high load, but not games, recently. swapped the graphics card and i'm stable again. is there any reason the GPU would be acting in concert with system load (and thus overheating)?",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:09): no. gpu is only under load when a game or so is running - but maybe the new card needs less power, and so you are stable again - maybe the psu was too small...",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:10): expose, i'm pretty confident the PSU is big enough (rated 450W)",

        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:10): this has been a very difficult problem to expose, i swapped the motherboard, processor, etc. with no success",

        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:11): expose, i had the AGP voltage set to &quot;auto&quot; - think setting it explicitly might have an effect?",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:11): hi Erkethan[FR]",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:11): I have a big problem. Can somebody advise me?",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:11): may be, may not be. try it out :-)",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:13): By removing my CPU Fan, the processor was torn off with the motherboard. It remained stuck to the Fan. :/",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:13): it was glued to the sink...",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:14): Now I have a dozen twisted pins.",

        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:14): sorry to hear that",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:14): can you bend them back into place?",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:15): Some are doubly twisted... :/",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:16): And I fear that many is slightly (and all?) tilted.",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:16): expose, i guess i shall. the only way i have reliably found to crash the machine involves mounting my raid array and running a lot of expensive processes, though, and since this means a 3 hour resync, i am trying to avoid it.",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:16): Erkethan[FR], you used too much force :(",

        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:18): I didn't find.. But I had never imagined that is possible.... The processor which comes with the fan.. :-O",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:18): Erkethan[FR], if you're ever going to change the heatsink, thermal adhesive is a bad idea... i assume it came that way from the factory",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:19): ... You think that AMD will accept to exchange it ? ...It is the fault has their fan ... :///",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:21): who made the machine?",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:22): brick&gt; It's a Box version, Athlon64 3500+ with heatsink and fan (&quot;ventilateur et radiateur&quot;=&gt; &quot;ventirad&quot; I don't know how say that in English.)",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:23): fan and heatsink",

        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:23): im sure the question they'll ask is 'why were you taking it off?'",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:23): brick&gt; I bought the component and made the PC myself",

        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:24): Erkethan[FR], and you used thermal adhesive??",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:24): a few",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:24): 'to upgrade the CPU to a new one' is probably the only answer they will take",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:24): that's the problem... epoxy makes it hard to remove!",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:24): use plain old thermal paste and there's no resistance",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:25): bjv&gt; for cleaning the hsf and check the thermal adhesive, I had 72?C on processor..",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:25): Erkethan[FR], you know the difference between adhesive and paste, right?",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:25): ive heard of them sticking with just grease, though adhesive would really rip the snot out of a CPU takign it out",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:25): AKA glue vs. goo..",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:26): brick&gt; uu.. it's thermal pate in my case.. I think..",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:26): thermal p?\u00a2te ;)",

        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:27): But now, my problem is : Try to Xchange with AMD, or try to do the McGyver with my pins?",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:27): why not try both?",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:27): do RMA first.",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:27): do RMA first",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:28): they will _really not like to take back a chip with pliers marks on it",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:28): sure, and once they say no, then buy some mini-needlenose pliers and have fun :)",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:29): arf..",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:30): I say they all the true, or just &quot;It doesn't work anymore, I don't unterstand!&quot;",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:31): you could try one and then the other",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:31): id just give them the &quot;BIOS said it was 72C, and now it doesnt even run&quot;",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:31): in subsequent phone calls",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:32): im sure they will take your phone # and info before they ask questions",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:32): to open an account or whatever. maybe try from work. :P",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:32): lol",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:32): i did a maxtor RMA online and didn't have to tell them any stories",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:33): Erkethan[FR], what was it, a hundred euros?",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:33): bjv&gt; If I talk about temp, It's look like a dead proc. But in reality, it works. (twisted pins excepted... :/)",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:34): brick&gt; Buy 250euros, now valued 199",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:34): :/",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:34): hope you can get it replaced",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (00:34): and i bet you will be more careful next time :)",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:35): sure...",
        "da785166998520d8584f0a2e6a8aacf2 (00:35): true, you might just be honest: troubleshooting the system, removed proc, thermal grease stuck and twisted the pins",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:36): bjv&gt;ok",
        "2fa200a05925ac274a6ce1b293e876d7 (00:37): brick&gt;sure, i've just read something about this. The paste will not stick anymore if you start the machine few minutes just before",
