        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (23:19): That makes things really complicated",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (23:19): It means reloading the whole widget",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (23:20): as widgets can use different start files for different locales",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (23:20): Please make that read only",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (23:20): it might mean that, but it might also be something as simple as resetting the implied base href",

        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (23:31): yeah, I'll leave it then",

        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (23:34): and while the problem I had back then, shin splints didn't surface, I now feel like someone has beat me with a sledgehammer",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (23:36): The shin splints is something I would get after a single run",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (23:41): c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774: I don't get your mail on package updates at all",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (23:41): where are you proposing that notify/oncomplete attribute?",

        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (23:56): I got shin splints about 6 weeks ago. My physio said to run for 2mins, walk for 3mins, repeat for 20 mins max.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (23:57): Do this twice, then remove 1 min from the walk and add it to the run.... repeat twice until all walking time is expired.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (23:58): Arve, the notify is sent when the package is installed.",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (23:58): back to the origin server?",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (23:58): (or rather, I understand that it the url is contained in the manifest)",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:00): no, it is in the update description document...",

        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (00:00): I both see and don't see the use of this",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:02): I like it... imagine that your widget is screwing up on all Nokia 95's... the notifier lets you know that you are maxing out memory on that device during install... you go and do some test and discover one of your images is too big... you fix the problem.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:03): something like that",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:03): or better still, you get notified that the update URI server has gone down,",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:03): you fix the problem",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:04): Very handy",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:05): of course, if you update uri and your notification uri point to the same server, you are screwed :D",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (00:06): speaking of which",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (00:06): I think we're going to need onbeforeupdate and onafterupdate callbacks",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:07): yeah, that might be useful. However, we could just shut down the widget while an update is being performed.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (00:09): stupid skype's CC processing system is down &gt;.&lt;",

        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (00:10): or you might actually want to prepare data migration",
