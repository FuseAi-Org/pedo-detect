        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:33): If so, then it's not directly related, but I may be looking at it for some inspiration.  fantasai and arronei and I spent all last Thursday talking about the design, and about similar efforts that preceded this.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:34): yeah, you should contact plh",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:34): there's a testing IRC channel on irc.w3.org too, or some such",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:49): (Since some email programs naturally change the font-color of text types in a forward/reply, and the sender changes that to their own font-color, rather than to 'automatic'.)",
