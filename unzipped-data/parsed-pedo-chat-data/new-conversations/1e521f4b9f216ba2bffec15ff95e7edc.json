        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (02:43): i assume it's supposed to be a number",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:43): 353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320, where does that appear?",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (02:43): from jatinder's telecon notes",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:43): looks",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:45): the UTC format I'm not sure about, I don't remember that being mentioned",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:45): but the millisecond resolution is probably because we were discussing the use a monotonic clock value as opposed to Date.now()",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:45): and apparently Date.now() precision varies across implementations",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (02:45): Date.now() also goes backwards",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:45): right",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (02:46): i personally think the right thing to do is to define an interface for intervals that's unrelated to &quot;real world&quot; datetimes, and unaffected by system clock changes",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:46): that it goes backwards, and that it sometimes has less than 1ms accuracy were there arguments for exposing the monotonic clock value as the animationStartTime attribute",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:46): yes I agree",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (02:46): and use it for all this",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (02:46): need to find time to write an email describing it precisely",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:46): so that reference to &quot;UTC format&quot; I think is bogus",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (02:46): cos there are some tricky bits",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (02:47): Is it just me, or has almost none of the WHATWG cabal voted in the LC poll?  http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/html5-last-call-poll/results",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (02:48): . . . Was I really the first Google rep to respond?",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (02:48): I don't care either as such, but the drama and hassle of the poll failing seems like it would be counterproductive, so I just voted yes across the board.",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (02:49): what's the hassle of it failing?",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:50): people should vote",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:51): going to LC is good",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (02:51): Why, exactly?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:51): there are some people who may try to create drama over it",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:52): (1) Going to Last Call, especially on a large high-visibility spec, can result in a lot of really valuable review feedback",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:52): the SVG 1.2 Tiny Last Call stands out as one that generated a lot of comments",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (02:52): &quot;The HTML5 testing effort is making some progress thanks to Microsoft, Opera and others.&quot;  I wonder how &quot;Microsoft, Opera and others&quot; was arrived upon.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:52): (2) Going to Last Call signals momentum, which is valuable from a marketing perspective",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:54): heh :-)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:54): well, in the end, SVG 1.2 Tiny is basically abandoned",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:55): Since momentum is velocity times mass, and HTML5 is a massive spec, it doesn't need to be moving very fast",

        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (02:55): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, there are some worthwhile improvements from 1.2T that will be brought over. but overall, yes, we're continuing evolution from 1.1",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (02:55): tries to think of some way to nitpick about the relativistic definition of momentum, but can't think of any good ones",
