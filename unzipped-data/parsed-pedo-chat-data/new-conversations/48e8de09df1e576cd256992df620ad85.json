        "3e49d4426c0b776106a241ca6729ba2a (01:43): I attempted to describe Apple's implementation, but that doesn't mean Mozilla is actually doing it.",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (01:44): I think it would probably be better to support &lt;input type=&quot;search&quot;&gt; with the relevant WF2 replacement features",

        "3e49d4426c0b776106a241ca6729ba2a (01:45): well, one of the things Google mentioned was that they feel Safari's rounded corners would be inappropriate on Windows, so they'd like to come up with a different appearance",

        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:49): hmm, less certain of either :)",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:49): I suspect the search box on www.apple.com will track Apple UI changes generally.",

        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:51): I'd tend to agree that being able to distinguish search inputs (I wouldn't want to be more specific than that in terms of conformance) and being able to jump to search inputs (e.g. with a quick key) would be good.",
        "3e49d4426c0b776106a241ca6729ba2a (01:52): yeah, Firefox uses it for things like the download window",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:52): seems likely to make the web a lil more usable :)",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:53): although it's possible jumping might be better helped with a container for the form as a whole (e.g. in case of search instructions).",
        "3e49d4426c0b776106a241ca6729ba2a (01:56): I recently implemented something where I wanted the functionality to basically work like searching in iTunes - it filters the results with each keypress.  I had to experiment with using onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup, see what worked and what didn't",
        "3e49d4426c0b776106a241ca6729ba2a (01:59): I wound up using setTimeout with a 50ms delay, to make sure the value of the textbox would have changed by the time my function was called...",
        "3e49d4426c0b776106a241ca6729ba2a (02:00): and added code to that function to copy the value to a variable, after checking to see if it was different, to avoid repeatedly searching for the same string",
        "3e49d4426c0b776106a241ca6729ba2a (02:01): anyway, it just felt like I was reinventing the wheel, and probably poorly.",
        "3e49d4426c0b776106a241ca6729ba2a (02:12): also, in my case, I want the little magnifying glass icon to indicate the purpose of the box, because I don't want to take the space to add a label, and using a placeholder isn't appropriate because I automatically focus on page load (so the user can immediately start typing to filter search results)."
