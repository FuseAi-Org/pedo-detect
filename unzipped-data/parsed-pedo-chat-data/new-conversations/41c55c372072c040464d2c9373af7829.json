        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (15:13): SVG is sort of part of HTML now, so it wouldn't be too heretical to ask such a thing :-)",
        "c472a8ecbb4cd66373e8fc6daeaab188 (15:13): Thanks, I am trying to use relative 'l' and relative 'a'.",

        "c472a8ecbb4cd66373e8fc6daeaab188 (15:14): This is a pie chart and that first example is a 45 degree slice.",

        "c472a8ecbb4cd66373e8fc6daeaab188 (15:23): OK, so It starts at 600,200, moves up 150 and moves left 0, right?  That leaves us at absolute of 600,50, but I don't want to worry about absoultes anywhere besides the start point.  So, from that end point or the line we move down relatively 43.93 and left 106.07.  That is the end point of the arc.  I need to turn that end point for the first arc into the end point of the line for the next slice.  It is relative to up 150, left 0, but what is the general rul",

        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (15:30): The idea was to M back to the center point, then draw a line out to where the previous arc left off (i.e. based on x, where x is the angle of the previous arc), then do an arc to the end of the new arc (i.e. based on y, where y is the absolute angle of the new arc, minus the position of the previous point because the arc coordinates are relative)",

Let me make sure I am clear on the first slice.  So, we start at 600,200 and go up 150 and left 0.  From there we arc left 106.07 and down 43.93.  The first part I don't understand is how I get at those numbers cos(45) = 106.07 and sin(45) = 106.07 but why are we moving to -106.07 for x and 150 - 106.07 (43.93) (or some other way to arrive at 43.93) for y?",

        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (15:49): and the 'a' command takes coordinates relative to the start point (i.e. relative to 0,150 (or 0,-150 or whatever it is)), which is why you get the -44 (or 44 or whatever it is)",

        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (15:50): I assumed angle 0 was meant to be at 0,150",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (15:51): so it has to be sin(angle),cos(angle)",
