        "6eca7b6342d09b0241ed0ddf988824a4 (05:50): sema4: So you're saying to compile on redhat get redhat and compile while using that OS?",
        "b298c80f5802052d219d5628662d71be (05:50): yes",

        "b298c80f5802052d219d5628662d71be (05:51): runtime: this is (i could be wrong) the same reason you hear kde dever's talking about &quot;binary compatability&quot;",
        "6eca7b6342d09b0241ed0ddf988824a4 (05:51): does anyone else know of an alternative?",
        "6eca7b6342d09b0241ed0ddf988824a4 (05:52): I have ubuntu",
        "6eca7b6342d09b0241ed0ddf988824a4 (05:52): but I dont want to install it, so Im going to have to do livecd",
        "6eca7b6342d09b0241ed0ddf988824a4 (05:52): and that takes a lot of time to get internet working and etc. etc.",
        "b298c80f5802052d219d5628662d71be (05:52): runtime: does live cd have the dev libs?",

        "6eca7b6342d09b0241ed0ddf988824a4 (05:53): sema4: I think it has everything that the real OS does, but it gets it off the cd",

        "2b6db9846d8b0dc02911bb2a7747880e (05:54): if i've got it, i think you can just setup a chroot environment with the os you need.",
        "6eca7b6342d09b0241ed0ddf988824a4 (05:55): aolph1: I want to compile binaries that work with Linux and/or Mac from a Windows platform",
        "2b6db9846d8b0dc02911bb2a7747880e (05:55): maybe you can do even better, getting just the libraries you need to compile the stuff... but it is a lot of work.",
        "6eca7b6342d09b0241ed0ddf988824a4 (05:56): aloph1: how would I do that?",

        "2b6db9846d8b0dc02911bb2a7747880e (05:58): runtime: well. i first would try to get at least any unix machine to try to do that...",
        "2b6db9846d8b0dc02911bb2a7747880e (05:59): if unsucessful, i think i would first try to move to another job! eheheh",

        "2b6db9846d8b0dc02911bb2a7747880e (06:00): but it would get a lot of work.",
        "2b6db9846d8b0dc02911bb2a7747880e (06:01): i would try to learn how netbsd people can compile the whole operating system from foreigner OSes...",
        "2b6db9846d8b0dc02911bb2a7747880e (06:01): can't remember right now, but maybe netbsd can be built even from a windows machine with interix.",
