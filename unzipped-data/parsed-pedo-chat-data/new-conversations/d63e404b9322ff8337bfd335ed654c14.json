        "c359f9cde4c4eb3400a3e3c041b0bc53 (20:21): Well actually I always used a light weight wm, like openbox, plus something like fbpanel for bars, but now I want to try gnome :). Of course, iff I'm not satisfied, I'll use what I used before. I'm putting X and Gnome processes in real time mode and see if it helps. Thanks.",
