        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (22:33): Opera has a reparse as HTML button",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:35): and mobile browsers other than opera uniformly treat all XHTML as tag soup",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (22:39): I think I mentioned mobile browsers",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (22:39): didn't know about Konqueror",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:39): i didn't see your e-mail, was just commenting on the above",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:40): is writing a long e-mail with wf2 examples for you",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (22:41): I just thought Shane might be misunderstanding the situation if he thought there was madness to stop that would be stopped by IE doing something",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:42): (The current KDE4 Konqueror does the same - I'd assume XML parsing is just a low priority item that they haven't got around to adding yet)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:42): (They have added &lt;canvas&gt;, though)",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (22:44): I thought they had an XML parser",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (22:44): I'd be surprised it they don't use it for application/xml at least",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:48): Version 3.5.5 doesn't do XML for application/xml, judging by e.g. http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/xml/parsing/001.xml",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:48): (I don't have the KDE4 version to test now)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:49): Oh wait, one of the tests failed",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:49): but only once, and I can't make it fail again",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:54): It has &quot;XML parsing error&quot; on 008.xml, but it shows both lines (and applies the stylesheet) on 004.xml - I have no idea what it's doing...",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (22:56): I asked one of the Konqueror developers and he confirms they use an HTML parser for application/xhtml+xml still, though they are looking to fix it",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (22:59): can anyone test http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/test-quirks.php?doctype=%3C%21DOCTYPE+html%3E with konq?",
        "9cff41e56d1357f56b3dce734bd43e81 (22:59): rrsagent, make minutes",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:04): (Things like &quot;&lt;!DOCTYPE html5&gt;&quot; make it quirks)",

        "b497e74592ada7e3180ca809515eca7d (23:13): I've reconsidered my position about validity and well-formedness... I'm still not drinking the koolaid, but I do see the advantages of the &quot;error handling&quot; approach",
        "1adba86c435b5fe0f7ea043370b1636b (23:14): &quot;drinking the koolaid&quot; is a bit pejorative :)",

        "b497e74592ada7e3180ca809515eca7d (23:15): I (and many others) use it for things we really like",

        "b497e74592ada7e3180ca809515eca7d (23:15): like, I say I've drunk the declarative koolaid, or the SVG koolaid",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:17): Oh whoops, I think I was looking at the tests in Opera instead, which'd affect things a little bit",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (23:17): sent some more mail about forms requirements",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:18): Ah, but it does indeed seem to do almost standards anyway",
        "b497e74592ada7e3180ca809515eca7d (23:18): one thing I don't like about XML error handling is the halt+catch(fire) prescription",
