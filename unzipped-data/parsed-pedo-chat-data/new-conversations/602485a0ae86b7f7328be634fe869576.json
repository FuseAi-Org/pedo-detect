        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (16:25): did we ever discuss whether XHR needs to say something about how to translate header field values...",
        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (16:25): ...from the wite (octet sequence) to Javascript characters (and vice versa)?",

        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (16:27): or are you saying it was dicussed, but not done...?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:28): there's no translation",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:28): basically invalid values are ignored",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:29): read the spec",
        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (16:30): RFC 2616 doesn't really say, that's the problem.",

        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (16:33): because that's in term of octets, not characters",
        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (16:34): you still need to define how to get from Javascript characters to octets",
