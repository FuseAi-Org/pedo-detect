        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (01:50): or wait",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (01:51): not sure, because it explicitly says in the description of the streams &quot;The two streams of character tokens together should...&quot;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (01:52): perhaps in some languages you would have the input in the middle or before?",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (01:54): hmm, yes, that's probably it",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:55): That text looks like it's still in front of the input box",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:55): (just with 'in front' being 'on the right')",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (01:55): indeed",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (01:56): RTL text still has the same source order",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (01:56): oh yeah, you're right",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (01:56): although the second stream of text might just be a POP BIDI character",

        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:00): or would it be better to email the mailinglist?",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:01): (but I guess that's because nobody uses it in practice)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:01): (but I'd have thought they would, otherwise they'd get totally inconsistent renderings)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:02): i guess we'll know when some browser vendor tries to implement this :)",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:03): cool",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:04): i'm working my way down in the tree construction process now",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:04): i checked it out the other day",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:04): seems you have made some progress",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:04): thanks",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:04): good work 8)",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:07): i mentioned ph5p at my presentation",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:08): yeah, i noticed, thanks",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:08): i saw it on your slides i mean :p",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:09): are there a lot of implementations you know of? or just the 3 you listed on your presentation?",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:11): not sure where he has the source of that",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:12): but those are the ones i know of",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:14): hmm, that's not a lot",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:16): would be cool to have it implemented in a browser, that would surely find bugs in the spec :)",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:17): indeed",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:18): esp if it's used for quirks mode",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:19): but html5lib could be used to download a collection of pages to parse it, right?",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:19): sure",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:20): or at least the parsing bit :)",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:20): or do you mean that you want to actually see how those websites are displayed?",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:20): ah ok :p",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:20): yeah, for that it'll become a bit hard with just html5lib",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:21): i mean to have a downloadable build of firefox that has a real html5 parser, to see how many people compain about their sites broke in the new firefox",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:21): just using firefox as an example",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:22): for instance, we might find that the parsing spec actually has to take &lt;script&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/script&gt;--&gt;&lt;/script&gt; into account",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (02:23): yeah, having a Firefox build with an html5 parser would be awesome",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:23): or actually, firefox already doesn't do that for standards mode. let's see if there are any bug reports on that",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:29): hmm, the  &lt;script&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/script&gt;--&gt;&lt;/script&gt; might include some reparsing stories currently. what do you do with  &lt;script&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/script&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;EOF ?",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:29): (or just  &lt;script&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/script&gt;x EOF)",
