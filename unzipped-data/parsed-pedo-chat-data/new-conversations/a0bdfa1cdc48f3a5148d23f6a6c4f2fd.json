        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:35): lol",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:39): opinions?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:39): I did some major restructuring of selectors api. It's now a lot more organised, but still have to fix up the nsresolver requirements",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:40): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Makes sense to have 'text' in the name, for consistency with every other text-drawing property and method",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:40): and also makes it clearer that it's a CSS style thing, not just a font name",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:41): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: would the value of 'textStyle' be a font name?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:42): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: it would be the css 'font' property",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:42): I think it should be called 'font'",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:42): most graphics APIs describe the way to draw text with a &quot;font&quot;, not a &quot;text style&quot;",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:43): whereas they do have notions like &quot;line style&quot; or whatever",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:43): so I do not buy the consistency argument",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:43): ok in that case please reply to vlad's e-mail :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:43): People seem to use CSS properties like 'font-family' far more than they use 'font', so the analogy between the canvas API and CSS doesn't really work since people aren't familiar with 'font'",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:44): right, I forgot that 'font' is a shorthand",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:44): it would be more appropriate to provide individual properties for the pieces of that shorthand, for canvas",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:44): IMO",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:45): yeah, I think it should stay as font, for consistency with CSSOM property",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:45): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: but fillStyle is not a shorthand, it's just overloaded for different types",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:45): imagines very few people use the font CSSOM property, so that doesn't seem a compelling reason",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:47): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I will have to do some study to give a cogent reply",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:47): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, it's fairly common to see people change styles by using element.style.xxx = ...; for a whole variety of styles.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:47): although I can't say how frequently each property is used",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:48): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: So instead of saying &quot;ctx.font = '10pt Arial'&quot; when you want to set the font and aren't sure of the current canvas state, you'd have to say &quot;ctx.fontStyle = ctx.fontVariant = ctx.fontWeight = 'normal'; ctx.fontSize = '10pt'; ctx.fontFamily = 'Arial'&quot;? That sounds quite painful...",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:49): couldnt both .font as well as .fontFamily, .fontSize, etc. be provided like in CSSOM?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:50): the CSSOM needs to be optimised for reading",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:50): this needs to be optimised for writing",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:52): but if the author only wants to change one property, without affecting the others, then having to use the shorthand all the time would mean all properties would have to be explicitly specified, or they'd be inadvertenly reset to the defaults",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:53): and changing, e.g. the font-weight requires specifying both the size and family at the same time",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:53): that's the same argument as &quot;what if you only want to change the Opacity component?&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:53): and the answer is, just implement the setter yourself",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:53): instead of bloating the core API :-)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:57): (and also avoid having it spread over a hundred thousand separate files)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:01): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: perhaps font objects could be added at the same time as path objects",
