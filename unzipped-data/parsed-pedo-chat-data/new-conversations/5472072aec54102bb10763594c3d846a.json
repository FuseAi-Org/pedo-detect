        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:00): not off-hand",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:00): but it sounds familiar",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:00): it sounds a lot like something you mentioned in a blog post, but i couldn't find a bug report about the issue easily",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:00): oh it's definitely known",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:00): but i don't know if it's filed",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:01): ok",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:01): finds it silly when people say &quot;We're also greatly interested in making our content accessible, to meet Section 508 requirements.&quot;",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:01): thanks",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:01): how about making your content accessible SO THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IT",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:01): hehe",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:01): instead of doing it to satisfy the law?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:01): isn't &lt;a&gt;&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt; considered illegal by the w3c validator?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:02): yes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:02): it's not valid html",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:02): still common though",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:02): right.  I think it's quite useful :)",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:02): and was agitating on here at some point for it to be added as valid html5 :)",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:02): just because it's invalid doesn't mean firefox is allowed to take packet boundaries into account when parsing it ;)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): 3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653: yeah",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:03): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: sorry, i'm referring to the properly nested version",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: actually per html4, it does",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: per html5 it doesn't though",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:03): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: the badly-nested one is invalid either way, but I agree that it shouldn't depend on packet boundaries :)",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:04): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: why, because html4 doesn't say enough about user agents to distinguish a desk with quotes written on it from a web browser?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:04): lol",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:04): 3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653: what do you mean by &quot;properly nested&quot;?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:04): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: no, because html4 doesn't say what to do in error cases",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:04): 3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653: i'm talking about &lt;a&gt;&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:05): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: oh whoops, sorry i'm confused",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:08): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: that's odd that firefox breaks on that; it would work if they changed the a to be display:block",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:09): the bug must also require nesting a block element inside an inline &lt;a&gt;, as I never had any issues with block &lt;a&gt;s with divs in them :)",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:09): the html parser doesn't take CSS into account, so just adding a { display: block } wouldn't fix the colors",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:09): hrm",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:10): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: does that test case still break?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:10): because it's working in my Camino",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:10): the layout engine has its own issues with display:block elements inside display:inline elements, separate from the html parser issues with block tags &quot;inside&quot; inline tags. the layout engine issues often have {ib} in their summaries.",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:11): so I guess that's fixed in gecko at some point :)",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:11): what version of camino are you using?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:11): if it depends on packet boundaries, it might be hard to reproduce",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:11): both the reporter and i are using trunk",

        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:11): hixie: yeah, i was surprised that i was able to reproduce it as the reporter described",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:12): 3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653: are you testing using my testcase or using the reporter's comics page?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:12): the comic page",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:12): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: but it breaks in FF1.5",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:12): i'm using a debug trunk build from last night",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:12): oh, okay",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:13): the testcase i attached should show the bug more reliably",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:13): a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9: well the comic page works on FF 3 alpha, and recent camino nightly, but fails in FF 1.5",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:13): but i'm assuming it's the same bug (document.write vs packet boundaries)",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:14): but your test case fails the same way in all three :)",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:14): ok",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (03:14): so not sure what the deal is there :)"
