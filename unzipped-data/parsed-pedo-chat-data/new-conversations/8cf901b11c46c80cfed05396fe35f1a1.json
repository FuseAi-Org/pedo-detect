        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:10): anyone reading the implementors list? just realized i made the first post in months",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (23:11): 9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b: yeah, people do read that list",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:11): I'm subscribed to it, but it's so low-traffic that I've never even bothered setting up any mail filters for it",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:11): ah, that's a good thing then :)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:14): 9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b: Most browsers automatically create the actual interface code from IDL (though normally each in their own proprietary format) then have the actual implementation of the interface separate",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:15): On a somewhat related note, is Watir 2.0 going to be API compatible with prior releases?",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:15): probably not 100%",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:16): (I ask that primarily with Opera hat on with a view of OperaWatir)",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:16): ah",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:17): it'll be mostly compatible, but more &quot;compliant&quot; if my IDL idea works out",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:17): i met Deniz from Opera at GTAC",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:17): Watir 2.0 will be built on WebDriver",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:18): Yeah, he's the guy who does most of the work on OperaWatir, so he probably has more clue than me :P",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:18): we're meeting in Oslo soon to work on the ruby bindings",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:18): but you're saying I could find IDLs in the browsers?",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:19): that's interesting",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:19): perhaps I should ask Deniz about this",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:20): At least in their codebase, it's gone before it even gets compiled",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:20): i'll look into that, thanks",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:21): WebIDL even has a defined mapping to Java :P",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:22): (Which I guess if you're going to use WebDriver is relevant)",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:22): nope, not using Java",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:23): i have ruby bindings that implement the WebDriver API (talking directly to the browser extensions)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:23): ah",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:24): so for opera, we'll just use Deniz' ruby implementaation of STP0 (and perhaps do STP1 down the road)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:25): doesn't really know how much about OperaWatir he can say, which is rather annoying",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:26): How much did Deniz tell you, at a fairly high level?",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:27): he didn't say much, just that the documentation for the protocol is outdated :)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:27): Yeah. It's awesome documentation.",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:28): but his java driver for WebDriver is almost ready to ship I think, so will use that as a reference for the ruby bindings",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:29): Ah, so you do indeed know that is Java. OK. That's what I was really wondering.",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:29): ah, yes",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:30): i think his main concern was having to maintain both OperaDriver and OperaWatir, so he's pretty happy Watir 2 will be built on webdriver",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:30): My understanding is that his impl relies upon things only added to Scope after 2.2, so it's highly unlikely to ship until we have at least a public release of desktop with 2.4",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:31): could be, he said he has WebDriver impls using both STP0 and STP1",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:33): we have a wave about it, if you're on Wave and interested to join in",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:34): I do, though I have looked at Wave once. :)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:34): geoffers, if you want to add me",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:34): will do. Wave really showed its potential at GTAC",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:36): really wants totally offline clients",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:37): looks at .idl files from WebKit",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:38): so i guess these are written by hand",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:38): Right, they will be",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:39): Probably primarily down to the fact there are about five different forms of IDL",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:39): (All of which are incompatible with one another)",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:39): hmm",
        "d8cc952a670b1063df4c205ef5e920ca (23:40): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: almost any modern browser has &quot;offline mode&quot;",

        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (23:41): full stop !! dump the databases !!! everyone uses sqlite, rite?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:42): That's still fairly evil.",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:42): And only works if the web site stores all the data in a local database, which is might not (it is highly likely it'll only download a subset, like the most recent 100)",
