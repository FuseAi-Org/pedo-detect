        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:12): installs KDE 4.0.0",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (21:12): .0.0 releases make me nervous",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:12): Now I can sort of run the canvas tests in Konqueror, except half of them say &quot;Service Temporarily Unavailable&quot;",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:12): b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: That's why I'm not replacing KDE3.5 with it, and am running it under a separate user account :-)",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (21:13): ah, good move. :)",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:17): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: cool. But if you're building from source, you're better off using 4.0 branch. I fixed a bunch of whoppers on there",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:17): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: and fredrikh made some canvas progress since then. I can give you my test results, but they're kind of cheating",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:20): b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b: I'm just using Gentoo's packages for now - would it be straightforward to just compile Konqueror from source, without having to manually build the rest of KDE4?",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:20): depends on your definition of straightforward and the rest. You'd only need kdelibs. But I don't know if gentoo does any tricks for concurrent installs and whatnot",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:22): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: do you have some sort of an AVM router?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:24): b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b: &quot;straightforward&quot; means copying-and-pasting a few commands to get it compiled and installed somewhere safe (like in /home since I don't want to mess up anything on my system) and running, ideally",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:24): AVM router?",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:26): german(?) router vendor of some sort.. a lot of people reporting the timeout problem seem to have one of those.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:27): Ah",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:27): I don't, and it was a server-side error message anyway",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:27): As for straightforward.. hmm, it's not too few commands, but there are howtos that are very safe, let me dig it up. Actually, if you're building with tests on, you only need kdelibs, though testkhtml isn't much of a browser :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:28): On a page with loads of iframes, is there some limit on how many concurrent connections Kwhatever will create?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:28): (I saw dozens of kio-something processes, which seemed odd)",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:28): not sure. I need to double check. there may be too many :(",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:29): note that there is a bug with onload events with many iframes using the same image -- that's the 'cheating' part I was referring to",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:29): Ah",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:30): Incidentally, please don't trust my tests to be correct if they're not saying something that's justified by the spec, since I haven't carefully reviewed them at all :-)",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:31): it should limit it to 32 requests, in theory, anyway",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:31): Hmm, 32 seems a bit much when most browsers limit it to about 2...",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:32): that's global for the entire process, though.",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:32): may be it needs some sort of fancier policy",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:33): should run the tests on his local machine instead of potentially killing html5.org",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:33): tests whether the limit really works.",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:34): oh.",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:34): there might be a problem with iframes without a content-type specified :(",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:35): wrt to # of requests.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:35): How do you specify a content-type on an iframe?",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:40): good point. only doable on object, right? :(",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:41): Apparently so",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:41): I used &lt;iframe&gt; rather than &lt;object&gt; because FF3-trunk didn't seem to do onload on &lt;object&gt; at the time when I was testing it",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:41): this may be hard to fix, will have to talk to some kparts gurus, better run it locally then.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:45): It's surprising how many bugs can be found in a test harness, without even considering the tests themselves :-)",

        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:49): the easiest way to build from source safely is to use this script, and not as .bashrc -- but an explicit one http://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Getting_Started/Increased_Productivity_in_KDE4_with_Scripts/.bashrc",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:49): then one can just source it in a terminal window for KDE4 stuff, and run things from there..",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:51): most likely working steps would be: 1) cd 2) mkdir kde 3) cd kde 4) download that script as ~/kde4/setup-env 5) mkdir src 6) mkdir build",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:53): 7) cd src 8) svn checkout svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/KDE/4.0/kdelibs 9) edit that setup-env script to remove the alias  make=makeobj line 10) cd ../build &amp;&amp; mkdir kdelibs &amp;&amp; cd kdelibs 11) source ~/kde/setup-env 12) cmakekde",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:53): chances of me not making a mistake there: 0.",
        "b19bfcbd7b695025e49d546be54e168b (21:54): actially, step 10 is not needed :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:55): Thanks!",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:55): tries that",
