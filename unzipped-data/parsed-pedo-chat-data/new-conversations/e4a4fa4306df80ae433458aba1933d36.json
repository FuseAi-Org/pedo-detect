        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:30): I ve just burnt my Athlon in desk station; pushed it away and replaced it with Athlon-M from old laptop. Lappy could support CPUFreq; I have recompiled kernel with that support, symbol is listed in /proc/config.gz but daemon complains symbol is not available.",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:30): Could desktop motherboard interfear and prevent using scaling ?",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:31): bios and proc report 663MHz CPU, and bios reports 5x/14x capabilities ... could MB chipset block something ?",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:33): hell, that CPU is cooler than previous one :) and theoritically faster (133x14 &gt; 133x11 :D )",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:36): the missing symbols thing has to do with desktop mobos not having the same frequency tables, iirc",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:36): doesn't it give a URL in the syslog?",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:40): brick: is there a workaround ?",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:41): cause, somehow, I dont feel like I am working on 663 machine, its quiet smooth ... Id say as much as with old core. but still I am reported 663MHz, *but* load increases very fast (maybe smaller cache ? )",
        "b384c141c17635701b3e6bf346bf3db5 (11:46): can i put my fx5200 on a PII board w/agp ?",
        "b384c141c17635701b3e6bf346bf3db5 (11:46): i think its an agp 2x slot, and the fx5200 is 8x agp",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:47): td-m: 2 can fit in 8",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:47): oh ...",
        "b384c141c17635701b3e6bf346bf3db5 (11:47): not fit",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:47): 8 in 2 ... no clue ...",
        "b384c141c17635701b3e6bf346bf3db5 (11:47): im worried about voltages and stuff",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:47): 2 vs 8 is about frequencies",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:47): voltages are ok",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:48): problem is *current* !",
        "b384c141c17635701b3e6bf346bf3db5 (11:48): i read somewhere that after agp 2x, the voltage of agp changed",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:48): yeah, to 1.5V or something",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:48): no, problem is AGP vs AGP-pro !",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:48): no body ever says AGP or PRO ... but that is a problem",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:48): some cards (like a number of the ATi ones) can adapt to diff AGP slot types but you';ll need to check with the card manu",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:49): PRO have the 16 extra pins after mark",
        "b384c141c17635701b3e6bf346bf3db5 (11:49): never seens an agp-pro slot",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:49): LSD`: can you help about my Mobile/freq problem ?",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:49): td-m: in fact, I d rather say you have only seen PRO :)",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:50): but dont know the diff",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:50): doublehp, it's complicated and i don't know the whole story",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:50): it will be easier to just pick a static frequency you can live with",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:51): think a lot depends on what mobo chipset you have, though i've no idea which are better in that regard",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:51): brick: BIOS can only tweak bus freq :s",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:52): brick: I feel like I am on ~1G ... but proc reports 1300 bogomips ; if I really were on ~1G, I should have at least 2000 bgmps even if freq measurement fails ...",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:53): 100x14 used to give me about 2800 bogos in laptop; now using it at 133, I should have 3700 bogos",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:55): oh ... average load is now ~0.45 instead of 0.20 ... your right, core really runs 663 :( I ll seek bios and MB for freq/ratio forcing, but I have little hope :(",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:56): i know no reason why the bios or cpuinfo CPU frequency reports would be wrong",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:56): you might need to switch mobos for more flexibility",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (11:58): brick: I am not to switch desktop mb vs laptop's :)",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:11): are Duron/Sempron/A.64 socket compatible with standard Athlon ?",

        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:39): brick: burnt desktop CPU, and put laptop's CPU to be able to oot",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:39): boot",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:39): laptop's MB bugs any way, didnt boot it since 1 y",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (12:39): oh, and you are wondering about the constrained clocking options on the second CPU? it must have different bridges closed.",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:39): no",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:40): in laptop, CPU has 2800 bogos, FSB100 and coef 14",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:40): in desktop, same CPU can be boosted at 133, but BIOS uses a coef=5 !",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:40): it reports possible coefs between 5 and 14, but default using 5 !",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:41): and I want to tweak it to 14 of course !",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (12:42): i think the multiplier is set by a union of the bridges, socket jumpers, and bios settings",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:43): old CPU had coef 10",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (12:43): so you may be able to use the pin mod guide to do this without any bridge cutting",
        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:43): jumperless MB !!!",

        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (12:44): not pin jumpers, wires in the socket holes, doublehp",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (12:44): depending on northbridge of course",

        "efc6119c5c49226b3c6c2d1334909bb3 (12:45): brick: mobile cpus are hot scalable ! I dont think wirering socket would be great ...",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (12:46): it just gives you flexibility you may be missing from the bios",
