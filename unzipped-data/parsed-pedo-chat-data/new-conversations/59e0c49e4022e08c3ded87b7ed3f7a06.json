        "e5b01d5d72cb7baf344a76f3287f55bc (02:21): Hi, I downloaded the 2.42 RC3 to play with the video editor, and it is far better than anything else in linux. One cool feature I though would be to be able to scale the movie clips (using 's') so that you could change their playback speed. Also the ability to control gamma and colour things via IPOs would be cool. And sound doesn't work for some reason.",
        "e5b01d5d72cb7baf344a76f3287f55bc (02:21): Still looks like it will be cool.",

        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:49): In fact what the hell is going on with CAD and open source in general?!",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:51): Are the coders-- especially the newbs-- realizing halfway that CAD is a little more complicated than they initially thought? :)",

        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (02:52): well, just adding measurements would add a lot to blender in terms of cad",
        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (02:52): which could probably have been easier to answer by google",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:53): Loaded meaning what?",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:53): I've been all over google",
        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (02:54): the last blendercad release was Jan 2 2004",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:54): my point exactly",

        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (02:57): there's Pro Engineer",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:57): It",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:57): Is it open source?",

        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:57): It has to be open source",
        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (02:58): why?",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:58): Otherwise, you might as well use maya or something like that",

        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (02:58): why maya?",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:58): because it's closed",
        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (02:58): probably costs arm and leg",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:59): that too",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (02:59): now you get it",

        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (03:01): you can use CAD in any setting",
        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (03:01): CADs are ment for designing machine parts, electrical systems, pressure system, buildings",

        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (03:02): CAD stands for Computer Aided Design. You can use it to design anything",

        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (03:02): CADs tend to be quite specific in use",
        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (03:02): yes, but where would you need a CAD for non-commercial purposes where Blender would not suffice?",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (03:02): Architecture and maybe some interiors and some limited industrial stuff",

        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (03:03): bobe-on: have you used a cad?",
        "eb1668e6a489c5639ec72e0626ee09ae (03:03): Maligor, I get the feeling you might do well to read up on the philosphics of opensource/libre software in general",
        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (03:03): wow",

        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (03:04): why L0GAN ? I don't want to design architecture",
        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (03:04): bobe-on: I just fail to see what you need a cad for",

        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (03:04): It'd probably be bigger than openoffice",
