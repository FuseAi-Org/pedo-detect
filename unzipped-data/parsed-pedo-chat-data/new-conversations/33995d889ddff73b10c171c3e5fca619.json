        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:08): anyone know why I am having trouble applying margin-top to an element directly following a &lt;legend&gt; ?",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:09): 8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33: presto",

        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:10): si",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:10): is sorely tempted to say, &quot;that's yes, right?&quot; ;-)",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:10): you must be an Aussie",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:11): no, just someone with a poor (read: awesome) sense of humor and a taste for horrible puns",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:11): :P",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:11): this is good, tho, should give me something to test against (I'm slowly working at implementing that in Gecko)",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:12): right now it's write-a-bunch-of-tests madness",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:12): then try to implement, then see which tests I screwed up horribly",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:12): 8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33: it's experimental with gecko and webkit",

        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:12): although, I don't know, the latest builds might have decent support",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:13): I implemented background-size in Gecko, and I *tried* to leave a test that would start failing when SVG support got added, but I did so incompetently, so it continued to fail",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:13): try them with prefixes",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:13): Firefox 4 supports background-size without prefix",

        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:13): 8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33: nice",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:13): but it doesn't do any special handling for vector image display with anything other than background-size: auto",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:14): at least, not if the SVG image is missing an intrinsic dimension, or things like that",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:14): ah, well, that's kinda sucky",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:14): contain and cover are the most interesting cases for that, I think",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:14): *shrug* you get vector images, which is a start",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:15): I assume this is just experimental anyway?",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:15): not sure how often people would want to, or will come to, depend on the arcana of background-size negotiation with vector images missing intrinsic width, height, or ratio",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:15): well, it's conceivable the patch could make 4.0",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:15): my mess of tests can only help that",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:15): but it's probably not worth betting on it",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:16): yea, I just mean your project, just an experiment, right",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:16): no, it'd be to ship it",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:16): I have an aversion to leaving things half-finished :-)",

        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:17): I want to beat webkit with a stick for this bug",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:17): or at least I think it's a bug",

        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:18): in webkit*",
        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:18): well, chrome at least.  I assume it's all webkit",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:19): looks",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:21): dunno for sure, but fieldset and legend are fairly hackneyed elements, and they might not play well with restyling",

        "5220e4152ba2b190163b088bd6a9541d (06:22): but seems pretty messed up, if you ask me",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:23): sure",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (06:45): guh, Opera only has the horribly un-ergonomic Ctrl+Tab for tab-switching",
