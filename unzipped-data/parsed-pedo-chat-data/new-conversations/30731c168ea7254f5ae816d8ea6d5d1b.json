        "c24781797c98640feb74dfa85104daaf (23:03): I'm probably missing something, but isn't `cat foo &gt; /dev/ulpt0' supposed to send foo to the USB printer for printing?  Nothing is happening.  It's a HP DeskJet 3650.  Or does it only understand PCL (and how do I filter it into that)?",
        "7f9c5e64ca9ab8d2ee03704097fd58cc (23:05): PCL is a superset of ASCII, in general, so it ought to just print CR/LF delimited ASCII just fine... in theory.",
        "7f9c5e64ca9ab8d2ee03704097fd58cc (23:05): the printer's busy light should at least go on.",

        "c24781797c98640feb74dfa85104daaf (23:05): Well, nothing happens.  What so ever.",
        "c24781797c98640feb74dfa85104daaf (23:06): There's this hpijs driver / server too, but I've no idea what to do with it (:-)  The NetBSD guide doesn't explain much.",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (23:06): tp76: Did you try hpijs?",

        "c24781797c98640feb74dfa85104daaf (23:08): Well, lpr foo adds the file to the queue.  After a few seconds, the queue is empty.  Still, nothing happens.",

        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (23:10): They only do that with top of the line laserjet printers afaik",
        "c24781797c98640feb74dfa85104daaf (23:11): Beats me.  At least HP is willing to write FOSS drivers.  At least that's a start.  I got it working on Debian GNU/Linux with CUPS.  Thought I'd try it without CUPS in NetBSD.  I'll do some more reading (I've to build hpijs from pkgsrc, I just pkg_add hpijs which did not provide any documentation).",
        "8d102cab8535e4a2d9e4ef284cd63b16 (23:11): I've wondered if BrotherScript is actually PS in disguize.  Even then it's only on the mid and high range models.",

        "c24781797c98640feb74dfa85104daaf (23:32): CUPS isn't so bad, you just have to install foothis, foothat, clutter your fs with 1000 files, hack some config files, and then maybe, just maybe it'll work.  &quot;Neat&quot;.",
        "2fdf22354aa095aa9d0574511025954d (23:32): but the cover it up, and mad eit work",

        "c24781797c98640feb74dfa85104daaf (23:33): Personally I think it should be as easy as adding the appropriate driver and doing `cat foo &gt; /dev/ulpt0' to print.  But ofcourse, that doesn't work for none-character based printers, AFAICT.  And then there's PCL and PS and whatnot *sigh*  The pain.",
