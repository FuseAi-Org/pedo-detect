        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:47): kinda wishes innerHTML always used the HTML serialization--even in XML DOMs",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (17:50): That's always using the HTML serialization.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (17:50): I know it's wrong per spec.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (17:50): Having a bug free impl and supporting something aren't identical, IMO",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:51): this is a fundamental flaw in the feature implementation",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:51): but whatever",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:53): &quot;Internet Explorer web browser use drops below 60%&quot; -- maybe that explains all the markety IE blog posts and Sylvain being cranky :p",
        "c0a6c470e31cd9d911b5082260cdca10 (17:53): That goes without saying.",
        "15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674 (18:10): does anyone have any guidance regarding source order vs the visual order? the only decent information we can find is : http://usability.com.au/resources/source-order.cfm",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (18:29): 15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674: I'd probably listen to actual usability experts, but as far as I know Google puts more weight on content earlier in the page, so having good source order can help your rank at least.",
        "15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674 (18:34): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: see that's the problem, there a lot of people saying similar things, however there is a lack of any evidence unfortunately. Do you have any concrete links you could point me to?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (18:35): Well, that link you provided is backed up by actual usability testing.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (18:35): And so seems reasonably beleivable.",
        "15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674 (18:40): yes but there is debate regarding the results of the testing, it would be good to have some official info from sound sources",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (18:40): When you say &quot;debate&quot;, are you just referring to the fact that the results were somewhat inconclusive on the question of source order in that study, or are there actual objections to the data in that study?",
        "15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674 (18:42): a bit of both really",
        "15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674 (18:43): I don't have the links to hand at the moment",
        "15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674 (18:44): Bruce Lawson seems to go with content first: http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2007/navigation-or-content-first/",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (18:44): Kk, then I dunno personally.  I personally prefer content-first for organizational purposes, and from everything I've read it's neutral at worst.",
        "15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674 (18:46): yeah that's the conclusion I'm coming to... the only thing that is pushing me more towards navigation first is that the majority of sites are structured that way... it's almost a standard which people expect",
        "15e961ef7eb5e456a7fff39e7a744674 (18:46): and if there is no benefit, I'd rather stick with convention",

        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (18:48): opera, mozilla, google are willing to implement theora in their browsers regardless of if it is mentioned in the spec.",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (18:49): and apple or microsoft are not gonna give in because of spec text.",

        "59239043d359e06fea10867d04b58a73 (18:49): doesnt mean we shouldnt lord it against them",
        "59239043d359e06fea10867d04b58a73 (18:50): doesnt mean we shouldnt put it in the spec",

        "59239043d359e06fea10867d04b58a73 (18:52): so the only time a spec is worth doing is if its unanimous?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:55): no, decisions made in the spec certainly aren't always unanimous. But they should at least be implementable and there should at least be a willingness among vendors to implement it.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:56): teh bottom line is, everyone knows the situation is not ideal. But trying to get the spec to mandate a specific codec for whatever reason will not help in the slightest to resolve the issues that web developers now face",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (18:57): yup",
        "59239043d359e06fea10867d04b58a73 (19:01): i relent to acknowledging there is no way out, that the whole fiasco is a huge grey area.",
        "59239043d359e06fea10867d04b58a73 (19:02): i'd like to thank binary42 for taking me to task on the legal complexities of the issue in another channel"
