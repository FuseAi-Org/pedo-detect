        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:01): as if not undermining prefixes or not killing prefixes were goals",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:05): pretty hard to write specs too without browser QA experience",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:06): commentators often seem to be confused about who does the actual speccing work at the W3C and who pays for their time",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:07): We need more than just b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9's article pointing out that prefixes are aligned with many interests but not with that of the open web",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:07): time to start a blog?",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:15): and using prefixed properties is very much in author's best interests",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:16): Because it allows them to create new designs that people haven't managed before, and blog about them. This helps establish their professional credibility in a competitive market",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:17): Even if they only use them in demos, the effects can becoem popular enough that people demand them on their production sites",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:17): Which is very easy to justify if it only breaks lower-marketshare browsers",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:18): Anyway, my original point is that galzou has been around long enough to see evangalism fail",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:19): So it's kind of sad that he thinks it will work in his pet case",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:22): This could use a translation by Mark Pilgrim, too",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:26): using -moz-, -ms- and -o- also misses the point. that pattern means there can never be a new entrant to the market who doesn't implement someone else's prefixes",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (10:26): unless he means that the browsers have implemented their equivalent prefixed properties",
