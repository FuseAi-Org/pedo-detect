I'm trying to debug an uncaught exception in testharness.js, and it's at the end of a stack of 20 recursive calls to render, substitute, substitute_single, substitute_children, and map.  Where render is called originally by Output.show_results.  If we just built the HTML directly, this problem would probably be trivial to debug if it occurred at all.",
