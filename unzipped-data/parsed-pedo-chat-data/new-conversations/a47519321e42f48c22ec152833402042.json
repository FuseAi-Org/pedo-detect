        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:32): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: After the second '&quot;' it's in 'after DOCTYPE public identifier state', and the 'a' puts it into 'bogus DOCTYPE state', which ends up setting the correctness flag to 'incorrect', so it gets treated as quirks",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:36): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: oh, yeah, good point",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:38): Oh, I just realised why my downloader was failing to terminate for one particular site",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:38): That site is an infinitely long radio stream",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:55): and only on my XML file of extracted doctypes, not on any other file I've tested?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:56): Oh, it goes thousands of times faster again if I set LANG=en_GB without the .UTF-8",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:58): even though it's perfectly fast on a different computer with LANG=en_GB.UTF-8",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (22:08): Maybe it does some conversion to an internal representation or some other premature optimization anyway?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:21): you say",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:22): i don't want to be the one defining how you are to do optimisations...",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:23): depends what the algorithm is",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:25): oh it wouldn't, and that's just a subset of defining it as part of a forward sweep in general",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:25): i'm just saying the spec shouldn't define ny algorithm twice",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:25): since the spec shouldn't be optimising",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:26): or rather, it should be optimising for lack of ambiguity",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:26): that is, anything outside a section can't affect what's inside it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:26): and what's inside a section can only affect the relative position of further nested sections...",
