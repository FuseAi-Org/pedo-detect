        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:17): well I think sicking wants to add new members to e.g. NodeList at some point",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:18): HTMLCollection has a named getter which would make that difficult if e.g. someone used an ID anywhere on the web and that matches the new member name while also using HTMLCollection in some way",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:37): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: is the preferred way to look at &quot;canceled flag&quot; after dispatch to refer to the flag directly, or to use the return value of the &quot;dispatch&quot; algo",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:37): the latter seems more natural to me (but then there'd be no reason to have the return value at all, I think)",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:38): the former looks more natural (using the flag directly)",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:46): could maybe move the return value to dispatchEvent()",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:46): &quot;fire&quot; only lets you create a basic Event, for events with other interfaces, etc. you want dispatch directly, right?",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:46): that's what i was thinking",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:46): no fire is also used for events with other interfaces",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:46): you'd use a modified fire definition",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:47): because otherwise you also need to set the trusted flag, etc.",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:47): yeah that looks contradictory",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:47): it's saying &quot;dispatch an event using the Event interface using the ProgressEvent interface&quot; :)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:48): not that it's not obvious what's really meant",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:48): not if you read it in the way that it's overriding",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:48): which is more logical imo",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:51): replying to clipboard thread suggesting:",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:51): 7. Fire an event using the ClipboardEvent interface, with its type attribute initialized to e and its clipboardData attribute initialized to data transfer, at event target. If the event's canceled flag is set then abort these steps.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:55): the if statement should prolly be step 8 for clarity",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:55): it was before, i moved it into 7 based on http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#form-submission-algorithm step 6",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:56): hmm",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:56): seems like having a concise pattern for this is good ... not sure if it's unclear or not",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:57): maybe I should postpone encoding stuff a bit more and work on DOM next week too",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:59): let me know if you think strongly one way or the other; don't want to bait people like paul by going back and forth",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:00): I don't, it's something that can be mended easily over time",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:01): especially if we make specs more hackable",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (00:01): (&quot;this spec hasn't been set in stone so it can start getting out of date, so everyone should use a useless, confusing, decade-old spec&quot; sigh)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:04): yeah i don't know what's up with that",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:04): i can sort of see the i want-to-play-by-silly-rules-so-i-cannot-reference-what-implementors-actually-need, but if you need to reference the newer draft anyway, also referencing crappy material is just wrong",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:05): that you even need to argue such a point because of some hearsay about &quot;hot debate&quot;",
