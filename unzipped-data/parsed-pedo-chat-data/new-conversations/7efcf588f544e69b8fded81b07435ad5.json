        "8b61c11eb8baedd53d2e99d1a01fa7bb (16:40): okay, accerciser tells me it's a push button.  so not a label, but not a toggle either.  My intuition said it should be a toggle given it has an aria-pressed attribute.",

        "8b61c11eb8baedd53d2e99d1a01fa7bb (16:46): davidb:  not precisely &quot;the wild&quot;.  and yes there is an element with id shuffle:  &lt;input id=&quot;shuffle&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt;",
        "8b61c11eb8baedd53d2e99d1a01fa7bb (16:46): it's a proposal for buttons for jQueryUI (not my proposal).",

        "8b61c11eb8baedd53d2e99d1a01fa7bb (16:54): tbsaunde:  because it has an aria-pressed attribute.  that's how one tells the browser that the button is a toggle.",

        "8b61c11eb8baedd53d2e99d1a01fa7bb (16:58): tbsaunde:  a toggle is like the play button on a cd player.  It has two state:  pressed and released.  When pressed, the cd plays.  When not pressed, the cd pauses.  Another example is a &quot;Bold&quot; tool bar button.  When pressed, you get bolded text.  When not pressed, you get plain text.",
