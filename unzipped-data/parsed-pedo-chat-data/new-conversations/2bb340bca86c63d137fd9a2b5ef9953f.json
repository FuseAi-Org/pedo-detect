        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:51): Hmph, now I have enough tests that Safari won't run them all simultaneously without dropping the last couple of dozen and randomly crashing :-(",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:52): that's good :)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:53): have you filed bugs on them already?",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:53): jgraham, you need to fix the encoding sniffer for comment handling",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (16:56): found a bug in the html serializer: &lt;p&gt;a&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;c&lt;/p&gt;  =&gt;  &lt;p&gt;a&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/p&gt;; but only if a character encoding is specified.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:57): does the html serializer implement the innerHTML algorithm?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:57): Looks like it's actually an intentional limit in WebKit - it won't display more than 200 iframes on a page",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:57): I honestly haven't followed all these treewalker, etc. additions",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (16:57): don't see 'inner' anywhere in the serializer.",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:04): maybe 200 object + 200 iframe? :)",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:05): I wonder what the rationale is for this change: http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=917&amp;to=918",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:05): Seems to be limit of 200 on num_object+num_iframe",

        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (17:07): was joking",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:08): Ooh, it even works fine in IE6",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:08): (except for failing pretty much all of the test cases, obviously)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:17): Also, I can't even do &gt;200 iframes by having 16 iframes each containing 16 iframes",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:18): that's what I was afraid of",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:21): supposes he just has to do fewer tests at a time",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:32): the change also affects handling of &lt;/body&gt;&lt;meta&gt; for instance",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:40): changing how &lt;/p&gt; works breaks quite a lot of tests",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:51): Aha, it works (about half the time, randomly) in Safari if I add a button which deletes all the iframes for completed tests and then recreates the iframes for tests that haven't loaded yet, and if I then change the text size up and down so it redraws the screen properly",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:51): ...which is a totally horrible hack, but then I already need another hack to replace &lt;iframe&gt; with &lt;object&gt; so that it stops being invisible in Safari",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:52): (though it only does that after it's finished loading the iframes, because it looks like onload doesn't run on objects)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:52): why do you recreate the iframes?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:52): just set frame.location ...",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:56): That doesn't appear to work (is location only set after it's decided it's acceptable to load that iframe?), but it looks like setAttribute('src', getAttribute('src')) does it, so that's a bit nicer",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:57): should probably just split the test-report-generating page into several pages of ~100 tests, and do something cleverer on the server side to merge all the results"
