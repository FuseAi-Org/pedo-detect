        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (01:48): oh dear. this &quot;low quality&quot; thing is going to be a rathole",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): it's the same style=&quot;&quot; rathole we've always had",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (01:52): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: no. now it is becoming a b and i rathole as well",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:55): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c_: &lt;font&gt; and style=&quot;&quot; are &quot;low quality&quot; because they are media-specific, and potentially hide information from non-presentational UAs.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:56): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c_: &lt;div&gt;s-containing-inlines are &quot;low quality&quot; because they imply some sort of paragraphing structure without giving any information about why",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:57): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c_: (typically, the latter is used as a workaround for the lack of a widget abstraction language like xbl)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (01:57): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I don't see how style=&quot;&quot; is media-specific",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (01:58): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: it lacks the ability to give different styles per media, but can still be used in media-independent ways",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (01:58): since in practice most styles are not media-scoped anyway, nor do they need to be",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:59): ok, strike the media-specific part",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (01:59): in that case, style=&quot;&quot; hides no more information than &lt;style&gt;, &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt; or &lt;style scoped&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:59): (though i actually do believe they usually result in media-specific content, even if it's technically possible to use them otherwise)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (01:59): none of which you have labelled &quot;low quality&quot;",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:00): I have to go grab a beer, brb",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:00): i considered including &lt;style&gt;, but in practice if you use a style sheet with selectors you tend to be pushed towards content that can stand even without the stylesheet.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:01): obviously though that's not automatically the case, which is why the other mode wouldn't be called &quot;high quality&quot;",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:05): back",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:06): if you include &lt;style&gt; and &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt; it would make it pretty hard to have a useful non-low-quality document",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:06): indeed",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:07): but I don't think there's any evidence of a difference in hiding information from non-presentational UAs between those and style=&quot;&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:07): oh come now",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:07): I mean, that might be the case, but I am not sure how you would quantify it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:08): oh i don't know that it could be quantified",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:09): is there any way to show evidence for or against?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:09): but it certainly is clear to me that you can improve the quality of almost any document with &lt;font&gt;, style=&quot;&quot;, or &lt;div&gt;s-containing-inlines, whereas i don't think the same can be said of all documents that do not have those characteristics.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:09): objectively? i don't know",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:09): i haven't looked at it in detail",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:10): obviously it's hard to argue against your proposal if it is based on an an unfalsifiable claim",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:11): it's not really a proposal",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:11): just an idea",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:11): i don't think we can drop style=&quot;&quot;, &lt;font&gt;, and &lt;div&gt;s-containing-inlines altogether",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:11): ok, s/proposal/idea/",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:11): but i do think that we should discourage their use in favour of the alternatives",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:11): Could call it &quot;Compatibility&quot; instead of &quot;Low quality&quot;, and have it provide the features that are compatible with implementations and content and forbid things that are likely to cause authors pain and not attempt to make subjective judgements of value",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:11): dropping all those would certainly make a lot of documents nonconforming for seemingly-gratuitous reasons",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:12): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: it's not really compatibility either, since if we were desigining the language from scratch, you'd still want these features",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:12): I just don't see any reason to discourage style=&quot;&quot; if &lt;style scoped&gt; won't be similarly discouraged",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:12): the latter can be abused in all the same ways, the main difference is that it is more verbose",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:13): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: i'm not even talking about legacy content, even for a brand new language with no content i think these features are necessary, e.g. for prototyping",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:13): and less compatible with compatible with existing UAs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:13): nor am i talking about abuse",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:13): you can abuse &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:13): and anything else",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:13): i'm talking about completely conforming and correct uses",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:13): ok, let me put it this way",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:13): I don't think systematically replacing all style=&quot;&quot; with &lt;style scoped&gt; would improve any documents",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:13): i agree",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:14): it's a case-by-case problem",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:14): sometimes style=&quot;&quot; has to be replaced with samething else, e.g. using a different element altogether",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:14): thus, creating an incentive to do so (badge-seeking behavior, etc) seems like a bad idea",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:15): granted, but it seems better than giving the impression that a page that uses only &lt;div&gt;s and style=&quot;&quot; is fine.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:16): bbl",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:24): I agree such documents are not great; just not sure how to make a good machine-checkable rule that detects bad style",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:48): yeah",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:00): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: i think having different conformance levels is a bad idea. we should just allow style=&quot;&quot; and &lt;div&gt;s containing inlines but perhaps discourage the former for authors",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:02): how?",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:03): by saying that they are conforming, and then having a note about why style=&quot;&quot; can be harmful",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:04): this way, badge hunters won't replace their style=&quot;&quot;s with more verbose but no better alternatives, and people can cite the spec about why people shouldn't use style=&quot;&quot;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:05): (i don't think &lt;div&gt;s containing inlines is harmful)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:07): there are pages that consist of nothing but &lt;div&gt;s and style=&quot;&quot;s",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:07): or even just &lt;div&gt;s and stylesheets",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:08): indeed",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:09): they are not going to disappear if we label them non-conforming, but some might be rewritten to use constructs that pass validation without increasing the quality or semantics",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:10): i don't think labeling them non-conforming will result in them being rewritten to use semantic markup",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:12): it might not affect _those_ pages, but i think it would help with people the same way that having &quot;strict&quot; vs &quot;transitional&quot; has helped some in terms of mindshare growth",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:13): hmm, perhaps",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:15): That seems to resulted in people choosing to use transitional twenty times more often than strict"
