        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:44): but if you make the bug be about that, then I suggest you should address Ian's argument in the rationale",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:44): well if you don't know what they do, you probably don't have enough info to suggest they should be conforming :-)",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (05:44): &lt;frameset&gt; is something that's banned because it's considered to be something authors should almost never do, because it has serious problems, although they might be tempted to do it.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (05:44): Which is why I didn't say all obsolete features should be conforming.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:45): if you say many/most/all, then you are asking someone else to guess what you mean",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:46): all I'm saying is, make it clear enough that no one has to guess which ones you have in mind",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (05:46): I guess I can present a narrow argument, and he can extend it to everything else it applies to if he likes.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:47): well, even &quot;presentational&quot; is a fairly clear category, though there may be edge cases that are hard to judge",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:48): most obsolete nonconforming features are that way for reason of being presentational it seems, but there are quite a few exceptions which generally have an independent and plausible reason to be banned",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:49): anyway, this is mainly my advice on how to make a good bug report - if you choose to do nothing, then the project won't blow up or anything, but",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:49): I think some revision would be wise",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:49): anyway, I won't keep you up any longer",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (05:59): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, okay, how's this?  &lt;http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9355&gt;",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (05:59): (now I'm really going to bed, won't see your response till tomorrow)"
