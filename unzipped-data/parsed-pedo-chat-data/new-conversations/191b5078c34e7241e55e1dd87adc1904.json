        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:42): what happens if you have  &quot;english HEBREW HEBREW HEBREW english&quot; and the HEBREW part is so long it splits into three lines?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:42): in ltr",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:42): you get &quot;e1 1h \\n 2h \\n 3h e2&quot; right?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:43): Presumably?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:43): Which is weird, of coruse.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:43): Or, wait, is that logical or visual string order that you specified?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:45): If the logical text was &quot;e1 H1 H2 H3 e2&quot;, presumably it would be displayed as &quot;e1 H3 \\n H2 \\n H1 e2&quot;.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:46): Since linebreaking should be more-or-less a visual effect where you just break lineboxes, and if the text fit on one line it would display as &quot;e1 H3 H2 H1 e2&quot;.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:49): that would be crazy, surely",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:49): you never read up",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:49): Which part is crazy?  The one-line layout, or how it's broken into lineboxes?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:49): the part where you have to start reading by skipping a line and then reading up",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:49): Man, I dunno.  You shouldn't mix text directions in a single inline layout anyway.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:50): you don't have much choice when writing hebrew",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:50): if the quote is long, it'll split across many lines",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:50): but you want the start of the quote to be on the first line",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:51): Solution: stop being rtl, or switch everyone to rtl.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:51): good luck with that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:01): i'm clearly wrong somehow",
