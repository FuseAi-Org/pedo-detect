I can never decide what headings to use for what though.  Should they only be used for main article content?  What if you want to put them in the masthead or nav?",

Canvas elements follow closely on the naming as syntax of svg.  Code written in inkscape can be inspected for structural examples and tricks.  You will probably need to use a temporary canvas for animation and multiple rectangles.  Have a look here for some tutorial assistance:  \\url{https://github.com/borismus/MagicTouch}",
