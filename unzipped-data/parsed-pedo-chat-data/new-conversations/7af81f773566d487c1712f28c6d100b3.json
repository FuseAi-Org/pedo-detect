        "4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9 (00:02): improving 65% of a page by 39% seems pretty good to me",
        "4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9 (00:03): plus transparency in a future update",
        "4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9 (00:04): this part seems pretty interesting",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:06): oh boy oh boy",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:10): i'm disappointed that they didn't add transparency right away",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:10): the web really needs some lossy true color image format with support for transparency",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:10): if it's something photo based, png32 is just too f-ing huge",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:11): 4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9: They say they saved an average 39% on a collection of JPEG/PNG/GIF images without &quot;perceptibly&quot; affecting quality",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:12): which seems a pretty useless number if I'm interpreting it right",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:12): because one person might have a photo saved as a 5MB PNG and they'd get huge compression improvements by encoding even as plain old JPEG",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:13): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, check the gallery: http://code.google.com/speed/webp/gallery.html",
        "4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9 (00:13): yes, that only says &quot;if everyone uses webp instead of what they're doing now, we'll save 39%&quot;",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:14): It'd be more useful if they did comparisons against JPEG re-encoding with equivalent quality loss, and against the dozens of other JPEG-but-slighty-better formats that exist",
        "4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9 (00:15): they did the first one",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:16): is there a list of SVG tests someplace?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:16): that wants tests added?",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:16): ye, a comparison with jp2 and jpg xr would have ben nice",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:16): 4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9: Where?",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:16): +e",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:17): well, in about 10 years we can use jp2 :&gt;",
        "4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9 (00:17): the link cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb posted",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:17): safari apparently currently supports marker-start, marker-mid, marker-end, but not marker as attributes on paths",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:19): 4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9: That says they're comparing against JPEG originals (which might have stupid compression settings), not against re-encoded JPEGs",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:21): 4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9: e.g. they claim 76% improvement on http://code.google.com/speed/webp/images/2.jpg, but if I just save it as a JPEG in Gimp then I can get 76% improvement without it looking much different",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:23): 4d05dc3c4352ebe7593b536f2078cfe9, ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: the webp images seem to have their color profiles stripped?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:24): espadrine: JP2 is used a lot by people archiving very large images",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:24): it's just not used by consumer-facing web apps",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:25): (The fact you can get a big improvement by just recompressing as marginally lower quality JPEG indicates that most people don't care about image size anyway)",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:25): decoders for JPEG 2000 are much much slower than decoders for JPEG",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:26): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: or it indicates that grabbing the originals uploaded to wikipedia is a bad way to find compressed images",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:26): I believe the wikipedia thumbnails are reasonably compressed. the originals should be as high quality as possible IMO",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:27): because you never know what someone might want to do with them, and they won't be served to article page viewers",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:27): ah, WebP is out",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:27): and my inbox is full of bugmail yay",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:28): Are there better benchmarks of WebP anywhere that I'm missing?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:28): also, if google wants to use the lena image, they should just ask playboy; the magazine hasn't had any problem in the past with its use",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:29): &quot;&lt;video&gt; element needs to support some form of parental control solution&quot; whoa",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:29): lets boil the ocean",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:29): the internet is AO rated",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:29): Better add parental controls to &lt;img&gt; first",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:30): using webp for images seems to me like a really stupid thing to be pushing",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:30): I guess they want to hype the video format?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (00:30): John Foliot is also asking for DRM",

        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (00:31): lol :&gt;",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:31): http://code.google.com/speed/webp/docs/c_study.html - ah, that has more data",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:32): yeah, their jpeg 2000 numbers seem pretty sketchy",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:33): is there any evidence that PSNR is a good metric for &quot;human-detectable degradation&quot;",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:33): Seems the average improvement over (Re-)JPEG is more like 20%",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:34): Are WebP and/or JPEG and/or JPEG2K optimised for PSNR?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:34): I'd be very interested to see what the JPEG 2000 inventors have to say about this study",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:34): also, they took existing jpeg images to convert, it looks like?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:35): of arbitrary provenance",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (00:35): some of those might be ickily compressed with lots of artifacts aligned with jpeg block boundaries",
