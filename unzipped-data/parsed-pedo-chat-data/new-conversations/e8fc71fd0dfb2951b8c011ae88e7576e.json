        "a56f1282e3747d430b45f7815a54f536 (21:56): if I wanna check what the value of a combobox named RepLevel is what should I type? like if I wanna see if its == to neutral, then whats the syntax? Have tried msdn but didnt find an answer :(",
        "d856d218bdb52493d33e28de9fd6d4a0 (21:57): when you say the value of a combobox, what do you mean? The text in it?",
        "a56f1282e3747d430b45f7815a54f536 (21:57): Year I have made one with 5 diffrent texts, I then need to check which of them is active when I click my &quot;bottem&quot;",
        "d856d218bdb52493d33e28de9fd6d4a0 (21:59): this.RepLevel.Text will give you the text string value of the combobox",

        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (22:09): wtf... a Static method cannot be abstract or virtual !?",
        "d856d218bdb52493d33e28de9fd6d4a0 (22:10): why would you want it to be?",

        "1cdb3bef16dddc3dcb4f8dd00d49b10f (22:12): StaZ[work]: ubt they can't be called polymorphically, so there's no need for it to be virtual",
        "1cdb3bef16dddc3dcb4f8dd00d49b10f (22:12): and thus no reason to enforce such a function at the language level",
        "1cdb3bef16dddc3dcb4f8dd00d49b10f (22:13): any code that tries to call such a static method will fail at compile time, so you add the necessary method",
