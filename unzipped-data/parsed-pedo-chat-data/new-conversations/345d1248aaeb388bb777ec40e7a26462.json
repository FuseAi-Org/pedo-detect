        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:37): othermaciej: but i have no idea if that is practical back-compat wise, let alone if it is implementable with good perf",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (07:38): hixie: did you get a chance to look at that event-source stuff yet?",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (07:38): oh wait i got an email back from you",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:01): oh heh actually i have another question about that",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:03): if you have &gt;1 RemoteEventTarget node within a single document, and they all get the same event source URI added to them, should the UA open one connection for each object, or just open one and then dispatch events from that connection to all the listeners?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:20): 7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967: i believe the spec unambiguously requires the former",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:22): hm. isn't there like a 2 HTTP connections per UA rule per server?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:22): yes, i wouldn't recommend that people have more than one of these things",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:23): yeah i suppose that makes sense",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:25): and is there like a pre-draft of what the Access-Control HTTP header might look like?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:35): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:35): www.w3.org/tr/access-control or some such",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:38): ah",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:50): i guess this is the wrong place to ask this, but i don't understand what this is supposed to accomplish",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:55): so i put a document on server-a.com, then another resource on server-b.com, and i want the server-a document to access the server-b resource....so now i have to make server-b.com provide an HTTP header that says it's ok for that to happen?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:56): yeah",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (08:56): how is this better than just having server-b check the Referer field?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:18): most servers don't check the referer field",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:19): so if we relied on that, most servers would be vulnerable today",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:19): but...zero servers check the Content-Access-Control fiel",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:19): no the server has to _send_ the field",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:19): i guess i'm not clear who's being protected here",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:20): the user is being protected from server-a pretending to be the user when talking to server-b",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:23): ah ok so this could prevent the resource from server-b, which is accessed by the user directly, from being sent back to server-a?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:24): right",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:24): (on an unrelated note, http://www.w3.org/mid/<email/> summarises where i'm coming from regarding the wysiwyg stuff)",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:25): though it requires server-b to implement it, and the UA to implement it, and also requires breaking all other current cross-domain communication techniques?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:26): no",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:26): it requires server-b to implement it only if server-b wants to allow access",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:27): it requires the UA to implement it only if the UA is to support cross-domain stuff",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:27): and it doesn't affect any existing cross-domain features",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:30): ok but tricks like dom-inserting a &lt;script&gt; element could still get around this",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:31): dom-inserting a script only works if you're inserting a script",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:31): so yes, scripts aren't protected",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:38): ok but...let's say server-b doesn't want server-a's web pages from loading its images",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:38): it could say Content-Access-Control: deny server-a.com",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:39): but that would only be honored by new UAs",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:40): i mean i guess that's somewhat outside the scope of access control's purpose",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:41): but it's something of an broken-at-conception default behavior",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:50): 7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967: images are also not affected by this",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:51): 7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967: this doesn't affect anything that is allowed now",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:51): 7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967: it only affects new cross-domain stuff",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:51): so it only applies in situations where the same origin policy is currently being used?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:51): it only applies in situations where the specs say it applies :-)",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:52): yeah right so &quot;To facilitate clear and controlled read access to resources, this specification defines a read access control mechanism that enables a web resource to permit access to its content from external domains when such access would otherwise be prohibited by a same origin policy.&quot;",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:52): i guess my question is....is there a formal definition of when the same origin policy is used?",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:53): i mean clearly it seems to always apply to XMLHttpRequest stuff",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:54): and presumably the event-source gunk",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:55): or is it just always left up the implementation?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:57): access-control only applies in situations where the specs explicitly say it applies",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:57): so e.g. xmlhttprequest",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:57): or rather xmlhttprequest2",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (09:58): ooo the sequel",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:58): because that spec says it applies",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:58): same with xbl2",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:58): xbl2 says it applies",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (10:00): alright",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (10:01): well i guess that was a key point i was missing",
        "7b55d0f261619a93f9ae615a3cb18967 (10:01): i thought it was more of a replacement for previous access control methods",
