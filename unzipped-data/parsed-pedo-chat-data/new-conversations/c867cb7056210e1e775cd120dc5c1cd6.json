        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:53): i'm somewhat shocked to discover that the information i've been relying on for the past god knows how many years has suddenly stopped being adequate",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:54): Because it's generally impossible to work out what was said during the meeting based on the minutes",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:55): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, it's because providing the audio for those who can hear it is perceived as providing more information to such people, than is available to the deaf. Whereas with the minutes only, everyone is at an equal disadvantage",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:56): why is it acceptable that people can actually call in then?",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:01): I personally find the telcons to be of questionable value, and usually choose not to attend. But there are some people who do find them valuable for whatever reason, and there's no reason to restrict them from doing that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (14:02): sure, just like there's no reason to restrict publication of audio recordings without transcripts",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:05): some podcasters do publish transcripts",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (14:06): i wonder if radio suddenly becomes unacceptable if they start broadcasting on the web, too",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:07): Maybe it's like &quot;You're not having any dessert until you've eaten your greens&quot; where some authority is enforcing rules so that your incentives are aligned with wider benefits than the benefits you care about yourself",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:07): wcag has guidelines about live broadcasts over the internet",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:13): the problem I see with the arugments about it on public-html is that the accessibility advocates are simply taking the moral high ground, rather than explaning what the actual value of a full text transcript will be in this case and evaluating the cost/benefit ratio",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:15): and they're ignoring the issue that arguments from morality don't carry that much weight with pragmatists",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:16): I thought the point of accessibility was that it fails when you evaluate the cost/benefit ratio - if it didn't, everyone would make things accessible because it's good business sense, but they don't, and legislation is often needed to skew the ratio",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:17): (Cost/benefit ratios aren't sufficient because they ignore unmeasurable benefits like respecting human rights)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:17): often, the problem is just that people fail to perceive the benefits of making things more accessible",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (14:20): that and the fact that it's one hell of a horrible way to run a community if you tell someone who volunteers to do something &quot;sorry but that's not good enough&quot;",
