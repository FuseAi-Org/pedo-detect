        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:27): what is the problem",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:27): I was getting MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION at random....which I gather can be absolutely anything. So I went about finding spares of all the various parts and tried them out one by one. The only thing I didn't have was another CPU...and I tried everything else with the same result. So I figured it had to be a bad CPU.",
        "9b84a0dcefb053223e5f052e9334530e (09:28): This old computer I've given to my sister is driving me insane",

        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:28): did you run memtest on it overnight or even 24 hrs",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:28): So I get my brand new boxed Pentium D today and slap it in the board. Now, instead of getting an MCE midway through OS installation, I get........",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:28): flyback: memtest came up fine. but just in case, i bought two new sticks and tried them out. same result.",
        "9b84a0dcefb053223e5f052e9334530e (09:28): worked fine when I had it, now reboots semi-randomly...",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:29): flyback: as i said....i've now replaced every single part in the computer.",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:29): yaar what temp on the cpu",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:29): and what brand power supply",
        "9b84a0dcefb053223e5f052e9334530e (09:29): mmm, memtest for a while sounds like a plan",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (09:29): yaaar: God's an AMD fanboi :P",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:29): flyback: woops, i missed a line. i meant to say that now, with the new cpu, instead of getting MCEs I just get no video output at all on boot",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:30): flyback: don't have a temp on the cpu, but it's a retail cpu/fan in an air-conditioned room, and this was the first time it had ever been turned on....so i don't think it could have been hot enough to matter by the time the machine was supposed to be POSTing",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:31): flyback: power supply is a no-name. but i tried my neighbor's really nice thermaltake one and it still gave the MCE ...that was before the new CPU arrived.",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (09:31): BIOS update?",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:32): ?",

        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:32): but if you tried a decent one then I dunno",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:32): did you try other ide cables, and other optical drives",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (09:32): yaaar: tried updating the mobo bios?",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:32): tjousk yeah you start with memtest also",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:32): flyback: but with the original CPU it at least turned on...",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:33): LSD`: a)I don't see how I can update my BIOS with a machine that won't POST. b)I don't see how the BIOS update would let one CPU run but not the other",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:33): yaar it could be a bad board",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:34): flyback: i've tried a different board as well. note i mentioned i have now replaced every component in the machine.",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:34): flyback: but also note that this board at least turns on with the other CPU",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:34): yeah but flakey board will sometimes do that",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:34): mabye you aren't mounting the heatsink right or something",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (09:35): yaaar: the board not posting with the Pentium D could be due to a BIUOS not supporting the P-D in which case a BIOS update might correct it",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (09:35): that's true also",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:35): flyback: it's pretty hard to miss with the new pentium heatsinks....4 holes, push until click...",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:35): LSD`: the original chip is also a P-D",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:36): LSD`: the only difference is the old one is a 2.8 w/ 1m cache per core and the new one is 3.0 with 2m",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:57): LSD`: turns out it is a compatibility problem after all.",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:58): the manual specs just say 'pentium 4/Pentium D/Celeron/Celeron D' but at asus' website it lists all the procs compatible with the board, and only lists 800 series p-D's....the new one's a 930",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (09:58): that's weird.",
