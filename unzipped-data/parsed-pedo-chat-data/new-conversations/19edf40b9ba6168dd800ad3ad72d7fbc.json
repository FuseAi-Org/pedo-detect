        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:05): you realize the can of worms it opens up?",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:06): well",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:06): we've had net neutrality all along",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:06): and that the whole thing is the story of the little boy who cried 'wolf'?",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:06): take away net neutality and we go back to BBSes",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:07): Bah. One guy made some stupid remarks. The blogger community cried and cried, and now the congresscritters are involved",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:07): When if it had been left alone, SBC might even have tried their 'toll lane', found out it would not work, and given up on the idea",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:08): mark my words - if this gets rolling, it'll become like telco regulation currently",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:08): ISP's will have to get legislative approval to *lower* their rates",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:09): well",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:10): true",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:10): I've read most of wat the savetheinternet.com bozos wrote, and some other treatises on this, and these guys don't understand networks OR free markets",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:10): *saod",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:11): I am reminded of the 'internet tax' scare of the late 80's, early 90's",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:11): blah",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:11): yeah. It's time to start fighting back against these lame-ass soundbites",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:11): how hard can it be to find a windows zeroconf capable web server???",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:11): yeah",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:12): I didn't actually get ticked about this till I saw last weeks NOW (a news show on PBS), and ohmigod, it is full of crap.",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:12): uhm, OS's do zeroconf. web servers run on top of OS's?",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:13): quux: well i need an implimentation that will run on windows",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:13): apache based would be nice, but i don't mind running yet another web server",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:13): I don;t understand how web server and zeroconf go together?",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:14): quux: ever used SUSE KDE?",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:14): there's a small web server in it",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:14): ok ..",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:14): basically its faster than apache on my lan, and very easy to use",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:14): i want to get one on windows cause my fileserver is on it",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:14): but zeroconf is SUSE's problem, not the web servers",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:15): and combine it with a VPN",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:15): nope",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:15): oddly",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:15): there's a java zeroconf implimentation that would work on windows",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:16): er",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:16): kinda like a lib i guess",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:16): IANAP ;p",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:16): wait. So this is a web server that assigns itself an IP ?",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:16): yup, on a lan",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:16): and broadcasts itself",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:16): again - why? The OS already has an IP?",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:17): so that a suitable client (i use IE+an apple plugin) can see it",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:17): well",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:17): you don't need to know the IP",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:17): and the KDE implimentation is VERY fast",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:17): well",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:17): It's funny. People cuss at netbios",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:17): mostly acedemic interest TBH ;p",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:17): but I see this zeroconf thing as a re-invented netbios",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:18): could be, could be",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:18): ;p",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:18): and bonjour to you, Mr. Jobs!",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:18): i don;t want to get a second suse system to try it too",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:19): i could, but a full suse+KDE feels rather impractical for now",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:19): quux: it's more like reinvented appletalk",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:19): if i knew java...",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:19): only less chatty ;)",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:19): oh and no zones",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:19): when you start having services announce themselves ...",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:20): and you have a big flat network ...",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:20): appletalk did that :)",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:20): worse than netbios :)",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:20): this is why MS ditched netbios",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:20): apple ditched appletalk, too",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:20): that kind of 'floating nameserver' and 'arbitrate by broadcast election' stuff just don't scale",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:21): and when it breaks, oooh, the pain",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:21): there is no arbitration with rendezvous",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:21): er bonjour",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:21): er zeroconf",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:21): so: how is an IP and netmask chosen?",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:22): quux: <a href=\"http://www.zeroconf.org/\">http://www.zeroconf.org/</a>",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:22): how do services differentiate themselves so they can be referred to individually?",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:22): the ip range and netmask is static, iirc",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:22): and i imagine arp for choosing the ip",
        "c3a1fa1c49c083817f4c74878181d845 (14:23): ARPing seems as reliable as anything for grabbing an ip from an unknown pool of a /8"
