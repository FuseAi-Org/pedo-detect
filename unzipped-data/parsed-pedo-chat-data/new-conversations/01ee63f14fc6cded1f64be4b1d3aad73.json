        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:38): proog, start with the UI tutorials",
        "9e5364e7f5889248dbc6fc5b6bbd1e24 (16:38): where?",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:38): One thing I suggest is that you change the way camera rotates",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:38): The default mode can be bit disorientating",

        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:39): open the &quot;user preferences&quot; panel, can you do that?",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:40): apparently not",
        "356f22f54974327ab2655968c96e1084 (16:40): :-)",
        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:40): The default camera mode is superior because turn table cannot roll the camera",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:40): and the roll part is quite disorientating",
        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:40): for you",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:41): There's no visual queue that a drag at different part of the screen will induce roll.",

        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:41): I didn't like it at first either, but I learned to use it, and now I realize it is better",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:42): Oh well. There must be a reason why every other app out there defaults to turntable style.",
        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:42): because they are not as good as blender =)",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:42): God forbid they've probably done some usability studies that even take beginners into consideration.",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:42): I bet blender has done exactly 0 or less usability study",

        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:44): proog, don't worry about the camera for now, go through the UI tutorial, then think about the camera and other settings",

        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:45): Any idea on ngon support that isn't a special case hack?",

        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:48): I think it's not coming. Even if it was added, most people want n-gons for use with subsurf'ed models, and the catmull-clark code would need editing for that to work",
        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:48): Haven't seen anything in blendernation.org, other than some user saying that ngon's won't hopefully be left for next SoC",
        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:48): which they could do with f-gons anyway",

        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:49): ngon/fgons, merely used the term to describe non tri/quad polygons in a mesh",

        "0aff76c67bf36e9ed57b09c51b405f5d (16:49): next as in 2007",
        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (16:50): personally I think people should drop the n-gon thing, and start commenting that it's subsurfed f-gons that we need",
