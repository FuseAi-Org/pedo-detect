For instance, most folks need a &lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot; /&gt; or something like that on their site.  Something that wraps all the pages content and separates it from another application on the page.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (23:24): And that lead me to look into the role document and application, which seemed to fit perfectly in this paradigm, and describes itself as such.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (23:24): And goes as far as to say this scope doesn't apply to the whole page, but part of the page.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (23:25): So I thought, let's take this great thing and mix it in with the existing need for a wrapper, consolidating the two.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:25): Semantics for semantics' sake is just as bad.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:26): Keep this in mind: if you use role nowhere at all, your page will be like 99.9% of pages out there.  Screen readers for the blind will be able to handle that.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:26): So it will work fine.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (23:26): What about consolidation by means of semantics?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:26): If you use role *incorrectly*, your site will work *worse*.  It might become unusable, even.",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:27): An example of a reason to use role=&quot;something or other&quot; would be &quot;so JAWS does X instead of Y&quot;.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:27): Where X is better than Y.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (23:27): As we get to know each other more, you'll learn I'm not a buzzword guy.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (23:30): I think there's a balance, and sometimes you have to edge past the 99.9% paradigm, get the test results, learn, and develop.  Then progress is made.  And it looks like I have good counsel in this room to remind me how dangerous it can be to force users to adopt my suggestions :)",
