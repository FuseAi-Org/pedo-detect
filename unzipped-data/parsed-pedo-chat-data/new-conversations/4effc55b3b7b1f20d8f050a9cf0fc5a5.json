        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (04:34): cuz I remember when installing sun cluster, it asked whether i had switches or not",
        "1c80b8bed70a687e9ee784f16b92fc27 (04:34): now I see why the boss doesn't want any new apps using oracle",

        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (04:35): but this is very fundamental flaw if it's true ...",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (04:35): sun should have documented it",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (04:36): well, not really.. it all depends on how you threat that &quot;problem&quot; ... what is a dead peer and what is bad interconnect and what is just a rebooting peer",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (04:37): so you dont' think i need to reinstall the cluster software ?  cuz that's a lot of work , now that oracle DB already has database on it",
        "1c80b8bed70a687e9ee784f16b92fc27 (04:38): brb I'm gunna try rebooting",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (04:38): another point is that sun usually denies you support if you install sun cluster yourself",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (04:38): cuz that's what i use",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (04:38): hm, i think we have some 3.1 boxes.. not sure",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (04:39): i don't have any memory of seing that question.. but it was probably there",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (04:39): you 've never seen issue where rebooting one node, the instance on the other node also goes down ?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (04:40): not that it goes gown.. but i've seen tns issues",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (04:40): since each node has it's own db_unique_name ...",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (04:41): if there's only 2 nodes, do I need 2 switches or just one switch for both nodes ?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (04:41): you need one, you should have two",

        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (04:43): you have one switch for each node ?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (04:43): or perhaps a pair of hp 2626",
