        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:52): http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Sep/0103.html",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (09:53): ah cool",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (09:53): yeah, actual user testing",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:02): man this is so interesting",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:03): in the first 10 minutes of the table video it seems the biggest problems are with a bug jaws has about colspan/rowspan",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:03): also interesting with the budget table is that it's clear that the headers being read out are completely useless",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:03): it's not reading the column header",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:05): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: also, JAWS has pretty significant trouble with thousand separators that are commonplace",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:07): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: yeah, the number handling is appalling in that instance",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:07): notice he goes to the horrific configuration UI",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:07): and does far better than I (a sighted user) did when I went there!",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:08): i think that revenue table (http://www.wisc.edu/about/facts/budget.php#budgetRev) is an example of a table that is badly marked up with headers=&quot;&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:08): &quot;source&quot; shouldn't be on the headers=&quot;&quot; list for the data cells",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:09): &quot;amount state revenue source. 151.8 column 2&quot; is not a useful way of showing that data.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:12): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: what would you do better (apart from striking &quot;source&quot; from the speech)?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:13): &quot;source&quot; is a header for first column, it shouldn't be given as a header for the data cells",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:13): headers aren't transitive",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:14): arguably the &quot;state revenue&quot; row shouldn't be a header for anything but the first column either",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:14): though scope=&quot;&quot; can't represent that while still keeping the row table-wide",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:14): which is interesting",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:15): with VoiceOver, I found that due to lack of easy documentation and due to the aural UI features being undiscoverable without docs, it is really hard for a person who isn't a routine user to check if something works in a sane way",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:15): i think you'd want that first data cell read out as &quot;255.1 millions of dollars, general program appropriations, state revenue&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:16): second cell as &quot;-1.7 percent change from previous year, general program appropriations, state revenue&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:17): though how you decide that the top header comes first, then the left header, then the sub-top header, i dunno",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:17): on the next table you'd want it the other way around",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:17): second data cell on http://broads-authority.gov.uk/boating/navigating/tide-tables.html you'd want to read out as &quot;1.69 meters, high water, wednesday 5th, september&quot;",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:17): I've only watched the first two videos so far",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:18): and I think they demonstrate that &quot;row&quot; and &quot;column&quot; aren't the real scopes but &quot;right&quot; and &quot;down&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:22): yeah that's basically what html5 does",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:23): (though it uses the row/column names)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:23): the federal bank table example is interesting, it's a table that uses scope but that shows jaws7 not supporting it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:23): it also shows that jaws has some heuristics to read out the first column even with no markup for it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:24): woah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:24): the immediate reaction to the first table with summary=&quot;&quot; information is &quot;i'm wondering how necessary is that.&quot;",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:27): also, it shows how the insistence on cultural variance in date and number formats is an accessibility problem",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:29): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:29): go &lt;time&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:29): not sure what to do about numbers",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:29): &lt;n&gt; seems excessive and unlikely to be widely used",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:29): i'd rather test the waters with &lt;time&gt; first",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:29): there's no way normal authors who are accustomed to type in Word would stop and mark up their numbers as numbers",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:30): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:30): same could be said of dates though",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:30): I suppose having a comma, period or nbsp every three digits could match a heuristic pattern",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:31): or apostrophe",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:31): but dealing with non-nbsp regular spaces would be hard",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (10:31): you could use lang to infer the likely number format",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:32): everything would be so much easier if all nationalistic vive la difference could be put aside here",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (10:32): or just try to recognize a bunch of widely used number formats",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (10:32): but I guess some are ambiguous",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (10:32): 1.001 - is that just over 1, or just over 1000?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:33): you're not going to get france or the uk to change to 1,001 or 1.001 respectively",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:33): (or vice versa)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:33): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: to some extent yes. but there are a lot of people who use English together with ISO dates, SI units and 24 hour clock for international communications",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:33): (in fact, it annoys me that legacy English date-time stuff comes with the English UI language on many systems)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:35): https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1968 for instance",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (10:35): there's also wide disagreement on the right way to do quotation marks but that seems less of a practical problem",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:36): systems would benefit from a U.S. English plus metric/ISO &quot;locale&quot;",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:43): sighs at optimism about parsing text/html as XML",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:43): back when Netscape decided not to sniff XMLness in text/html in Mozilla, O'Reilly was ill-formed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:44): wow the longdesc=&quot;&quot; comments are really interesting too",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (10:44): good luck with others getting it right if the xml.com folks don't",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:44): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: http://www.damowmow.com/playground/html-or-xml.html ! :-D",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:01): wow, I didn't realise screen readers were sooo bad at reading out numbers!",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:02): I would have expected it to read 278,000 as &quot;two hundred and seventy eight thousand&quot;, not &quot;two seven eight zero zero zero&quot;",
        "55c91f724bbdbdcd4c8ef11d65ef64f7 (11:03): it changes dependent on the screen reader I believe (and version of the software), but in general they aren't great",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:04): hmm. I guess.  So is it a problem that screen readers should really solve, or do we need a number element? like &lt;n&gt;278,000&lt;/n&gt;",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:05): I wonder how they handle numbers written using with the use of ',' (separator) and '.' (decimal point) reversed",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:06): is it known how much http://www.nvda-project.org/ sucks/rocks compared to JAWS?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:07): cool, I didn't know there was an open source screen reader available. I wonder how mature it is",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:08): well, I guess it's only version 0.5, so probably not very mature",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:10): lachy: as far as i can tell that's a jaws bug that the experienced jaws user hadn't seen before",
