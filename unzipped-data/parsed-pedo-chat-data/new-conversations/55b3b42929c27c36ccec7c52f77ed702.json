I get the sense it'll be part of C# 3.0, but for the time being, this link will have to do: <a href=\"http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/04/23/7685.aspx\">http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/04/23/7685.aspx</a>  However, it looks to me like the map function can be written more concisely as public static IEnumerable Map(Delegate proc, params IEnumerable[] lists) { foreach (array args[] in lists) { yield return Apply(proc, args); } } ? I'm",

        "06fb73bc6b8ffa5c6b430700c676fa75 (07:09): what varient of md5 is the one in System.Cryptography?",
        "06fb73bc6b8ffa5c6b430700c676fa75 (07:09): sorry.. System.Security.Cryptography",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (07:10): Poeir, answering your question would involve a non-trivial amount of time testing your proposed changes.  At first glance nothing seems wrong with them.",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:10): chaka: Well, I'll test them next time I'm at a C# compiler.  It really looks like it can be simplified to that point, but it seems remarkable that someone would have written that much code if it wasn't necessary.",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:13): Maybe it should be &quot;object[] args&quot; instead of &quot;array args[]&quot;...  Damn, I should go get Mono.",

        "84a2be5283835fa4655d5038fc297929 (07:35): i've got a question. What exactly is c# other than a programming language ?",
        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (07:38): who told you it was something else? =)",
        "84a2be5283835fa4655d5038fc297929 (07:39): I was just wondering how it differs from c or c++",
        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (07:39): it's a programming language that is usually compiled to Common IL to target a Common Language Runtime, rather than native code",
        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (07:40): the language syntax is similar to Java in many respects",
        "3428cf496526a43f89daf493ae013e1d (07:40): very similar to java",
        "84a2be5283835fa4655d5038fc297929 (07:40): Do you program in it basically the same as c, or does it seem to be easier ?",

        "84a2be5283835fa4655d5038fc297929 (07:42): I'm going to see if I can find a book or website online for learning to program in it",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:43): [Ex0r]: Nice managed code, it's got that over C++.  And it doesn't have a ton of semantic overhead like Java.  Personally, I'm a fan of 2.0 for its allowance of functional styles of programming.  Apparently 3.0 will have even more, and of course F# is straight-up functional.",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:44): jwormy: Personally, so far, though it hasn't been very long, I've really preferred C#'s handling of exceptions over Java's.  Because you can just &quot;throw new ArgumentNullException();&quot; or whatever.",
        "3428cf496526a43f89daf493ae013e1d (07:45): Poeir: you can throw exceptions in java also?",
        "3428cf496526a43f89daf493ae013e1d (07:45): Poeir: i hate that they can go unchecked",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:45): jwormy: Yeah, but it's my understanding that you have to declare them first.  Perhaps I'm mistaken, I haven't looked too much into Java because I never liked it.",
        "3428cf496526a43f89daf493ae013e1d (07:45): Poeir: i dunno maybe i just dislike msdn but eh i hate that its hard (to me) to find out what exceptions are thrown at times also",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:45): I like Scheme, Ruby, Python, C#, C for some things, those are probably my top 5.",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:46): jwormy: Yeah, that's one thing Java has over it, because it has &quot;throws NullArgumentException&quot; or whatever it is.",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:46): You'd think that would be autogenerated documentation.  Just go through the function and see what it can throw.",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:46): It's just a matter of walking the tree, which the View Callers thing in VS already does.",

        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:47): jwormy: Which thing?  I said a bunch of things that you might not like there.",

        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:48): Well, so far I haven't dealt with catching them.  I really should.  But it was only a couple weeks ago I started to get going in C# at all.  So naturally the second thing I do is try to figure out how to drag map and apply into it.",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:49): What I really want to do is write a map function that parallelizes everything, so that I can just go map(function, args) and it automatically runs on multiple cores.",
        "78218ef4d37bc7b413833ea0b5d232b2 (07:52): I'm half-tempted to try to make a Lisp interpreter in C# that I can just call inside my code.",
