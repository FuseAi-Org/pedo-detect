        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:31): The schema.org workshop, presumably.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:31): can no longer keep up with all the semi-secret meetings",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:31): you're not missing anything",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:31): (from the whatwg perspective anyway)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:33): can someone teach me what a singular transform matrix's implications are?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:34): wikipedia's math pages are inpenetrable",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:35): A simular matrix doesn't have an inverse, so I guess once loses information e.g. by mapping points from an area onto a line",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:36): doesn't know if that is helpful",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:36): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, it has derivative zero.  It's not invertible.  Geometrically, it multiplies areas by zero, so in two dimensions, it maps planes to points or lines.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:36): Anything specific you want to know?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:37): Singular vs. invertible is one of the basic differences you can have with matrices, so there are tons of things to say about it.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:37): if you have a plane and your transform it by a singular matrix, where is the resulting point or line?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:38): i guess it's got zero thickness so it doesn't matter",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:38): Right.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:38): i'm trying to work out why browsers can't just implement the spec with singular matrices, instead needing some special text for them",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:38): If it's a regular 2x2 matrix, it will map the plane to either the origin or a line through the origin.  If it's an augmented matrix, it transforms affinely instead of linearly, so the point or line can be anywhere.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:39): What exactly constitutes &quot;singular&quot; when your matrix's values are floating-points is nonobvious.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:39): by derivative, 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 meant determinant",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:39): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: yeah that's why i was hoping there'd be a nice way to not answer the question",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:39): So I did.  How embarrasing.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:39): embarrassing.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:40): Anyway, your questions have veered into the highly practical, so I don't think my expertise will be of much use.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:40): hah",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:40): I think it really depends on the wording of the spec whether it needs to make a special case for singular matrices",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:41): likewise for code",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:41): but there are some things where it's certainly unavoidable",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:41): like if we add an API for getting &quot;coordinates in the space of element A&quot; to &quot;... of element B&quot;",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:42): if there's a singular transform between them, then there's no answer to the question in one direction (except for a narrow set of points) and lots of answers the other way",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:43): likewise, there are a bunch of algorithms that have a &quot;divide by the determinant&quot; step, which doesn't work so well when it's 0.  Usually such algorithms don't make any sense to apply to singular transforms anyway.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:43): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, ^",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:43): yeah",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:43): but the spec still needs to say what it does (return 0, throw exception, etc.)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:44): well luckily for me i don't think i have anything that returns points or divides anything by anything",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:44): however",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:44): people have nonetheless asked the question",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:44): (e.g., when animating transforms, the fallback case is to decompose the matrix and animate the pieces -- and the decomposition algorithm doesn't work on singular matrices)",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:45): asked the question about what?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:45): &quot;what should happen if you have a singular transformation matrix&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:46): e.g. if you call c.scale(0,1); and then c.fill(); with a path",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:46): ah, so these are questions about canvas",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:46): I think that's easy: nothing.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:48): though if the path was set *before* the scale...?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:48): the path is non-zero",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:48): (does the scale affect it?)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:48): the fill is all that is scaled",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (00:48): hmmm, I don't remember canvas well enough to discuss this intelligently",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (00:49): istm the canvas spec should align with the 2d/3d css transforms specs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:50): if img1 is a mostly green image, in webkit, this is a mostly green rectangle:",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:50): c.beginPath(); c.rect(100,100,100,100); c.fillStyle = c.createPattern(img1, 'repeat');",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:50): c.scale(0.000000000000000000000000000000000001,1);",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:50): c.fill();",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:50): but if i add one &quot;0&quot; to that number, it no longer paints anything.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:51): because repeating a zero-width image across the plane doesn't make much sense",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:51): but what about if the fill is a color?",
        "bdf7d7409da19264fa0c4bf6b4f2d0cc (00:52): if it does nothing, does the globalCompositeOperation still apply?",
        "bdf7d7409da19264fa0c4bf6b4f2d0cc (00:52): if i do c.globalCompositeOperation=&quot;copy&quot;; c.scale(0,1); makePath(c); c.fill();",
        "bdf7d7409da19264fa0c4bf6b4f2d0cc (00:52): is my canvas now empty?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:53): not in webkit",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:53): however",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:53): If we had perfect precision, all this stuff would be well-defined.  But some things suddenly behave differently at determinant zero compared to determinant epsilon, and there's no difference with floating-point . . .",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:53): I think the reason the spec doesn't return points or divide anything by anything is that it doesn't actually define the algorithms to render things (which can do those things)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:54): if you set it to   c.scale(0.000000000000000000000000000000000001,1);",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:54): then it is empty",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:54): so there's a difference between c.scale(0.000000000000000000000000000000000001,1);, c.scale(0.00000000000000000000000000000000001,1);, and c.scale(0.00000000000000000000000000000000000,1);",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:55): that is, c.scale(1e-36,1);, c.scale(1e-37,1); and c.scale(0,1);",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:06): At least that I see.",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (01:15): they measure it in &quot;GB-months&quot;, which I think means to multiply by the amount of time, eg. 2 GB for two weeks is one GB-month",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (01:16): (don't use a petabyte of storage and blame me for the billing if I'm wrong, though)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:20): i wonder how often they sample",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:24): They're providing block devices, not filesystems, so they don't have to sample.  They can just record the creation and destruction times of each volume.",
