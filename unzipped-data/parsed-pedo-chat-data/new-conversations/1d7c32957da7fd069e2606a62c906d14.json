        "436b4c692eda8bdb8bdc762f31344cd8 (14:25): YazzY: aren't you trying to build pf with altq ?",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:28): lama: of course not",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:28): it's not related to pf either",
        "436b4c692eda8bdb8bdc762f31344cd8 (14:32): there is a tag with pf-altq (peter-altq) soon it should be merged with HEAD",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:34): what does it have to do with XEN3 ?",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:34): besides i am fully aware of pf and altq status",
        "436b4c692eda8bdb8bdc762f31344cd8 (14:36): oh, you mean pf doesn't compile with XEN3? sorry I'm not here all the time to read everything",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (14:36): Yazzy, ok, that's not very good news. Maybe status changes when Peter's work is merged with HEAD.",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (14:36): However, I don't know whether/how it influences XEN3",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (14:37): (probably yes)",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (14:37): Yazzy, did you try also altq as a LKM?",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:37): lama: not really, the problem seems to be somewhere else, i am compiling the generic XEN3_DOM0 kernel now, it's possible my custom XEN2_DOM0 kernel does not include something needed for the new config",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:38): ok, once again",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:38): this problem is NOT pf related and I am NOT using ALTQ",

        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (14:38): ok :)",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:39): XEN3_DOM0 includes XEN2_DOM0 config",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:39): and my custom XEN2_DOM0 config may be lacking something",

        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (14:44): Yazzy, you run completely in &quot;current&quot;? (I use current kernel, but all the rest is 3.0 (except config I think))",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:44): juhe: yes, the userbase is current too",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (14:44): compiled with gcc 4",

        "436b4c692eda8bdb8bdc762f31344cd8 (14:45): now it uses gcc4 by default",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (14:46): I nod to your answer - i.e. accepted you are using gcc 4 current userbase",

        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (14:47): I was lazy to compile userland - although there can be problems with current kernel and 3.0 userbase :)",
