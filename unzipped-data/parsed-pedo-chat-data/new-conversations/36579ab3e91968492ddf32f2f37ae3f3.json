        "e1b6d0b431cf5281f54819dfc2735b42 (17:37): yeah I agree - personally I think browsers should do nothing other than render html/css and run javascript",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:39): was just at a talk about V8, and the person said Chrome OS wouldn't have device drivers written in JS :-(",
