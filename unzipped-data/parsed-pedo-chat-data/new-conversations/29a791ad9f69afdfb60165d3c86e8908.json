        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:36): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: dunno",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:36): b",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:36): but if there is money to be made from it in selling more devices, I'd think so",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:38): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: back when Finland tried this, we got a couple of crappy computers from Fujitsu with built-in support. that was it. Fortunately, the whole thing flopped.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:39): yeah, I wonder how the current trend will play out in the long run",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:42): also, I don't really want any special interest to replay the digital tv coup, where they made a lot of people replace hardware just because",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:42): yeah, that would be bad",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:42): but in this case, people seem to like the convenience",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:42): hahahahah",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:42): this smart card stuff has nothing to do with user convenience",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:42): oh",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:43): it's all about vendors convincing governments that there's a problem that needs solving",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:43): ah",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:43): when that same problem has never been equally solved pre-Internet and the sky hasn't fallen",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:44): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: sorry if &quot;hahahahah&quot; was rude.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:44): but this is so far removed from the needs of the *users*",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:44): I guess I don't really know what the difference is between smart cards and the contactless cards and e-wallet features on mobile phones we have in Japan",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:44): no problem man :)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:45): you should laugh more often!",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:45): I'm glad to provide some mirth",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:46): anyway, the use case I had in mind is just the use case of being able to pay for stuff easily without needing to carry cash",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:47): I take it that in Europe, the use case that the vendors are trying to sell governments on is just electronic identification",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:47): what goverments in Europe try to do is to make login to government Web sites more &quot;secure&quot; than login to Google or Paypal",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:48): and more secure than login to banks",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:48): aha",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:49): Hmm, the situation we have is that login to government websites is pretty much equivalent to login to banks",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:49): because, you know, no one has never just phoned a government office and stated their name and id number",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:49): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: in Finland, login to goverment sites is now outsourced to banks, because the smart card thing sucked so badly",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:49): Right, taht is mostly the case here",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:50): There are various identity providers and banks are one of them",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:50): Banks in turn are typically protected by some kind of hardware challenge/response system",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:51): this situation is *much* better than smart cards, because because typing some numbers from a laminated piece of paper is browser, OS and device-neutral",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:51): (not sure if I am using the right technical terms here)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:51): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: over here, the &quot;hardware&quot; that the user possesses is a piece of paper with some plastic coating",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:51): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: works great except with gullible people and phishing",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:51): (but the system is device neutral to the extent that the bank website works on different devices/browsers)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:52): (and one option for government login requires java. There is also a mobile phone based alternative)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:52): but then, smart cards are also vulnerable to gullible users",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:53): in fact, using smart cards requires more leaps of faith from the user",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:54): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Here you get some hardware for which you have a PIN. The bank site presents a number, you enter that number into the device and then enter the corresponding number into the bank website.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:55): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I guess that protects gullible people from blatant phishing better than what we have",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:55): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: but probably doesn't help people who are excessively gullible",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:55): compared to the piece of paper that is",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:56): with the piece of paper, the bank is supposed to ask for one printed number at a time",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:57): but since the user has all the numbers available, a particularly audacious phisher can ask the user to type *all* of them at once",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:57): of course, the user has to be super-gullible to fall for that one",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:57): I don't know if people who fall for that one can be helped in terms of computer security",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:06): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I'm wondering how the validator deals with &quot;xmlns:&quot; in text/html",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:07): I see the parser does not expose &quot;xmlns:*&quot; as attributes to the rest of the SAX pipeline",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:07): as far as I can see",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:08): and doesn't support the sax namespace-prefixes feature",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:09): so I'm wondering how the validator service is able to see report xmlnis:* attributes",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:11): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: IIRC, the parser reports them, then doesn't show them to the pipeline",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:12): ah, OK",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:13): hmm, but jing sees them",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:13): oh.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:13): then I misremember",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:14): well, I mean I can see that the error message seems to be a kind that jing emits",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:14): &quot;Attribute xmlns:foo not allowed here&quot;",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:16): that's in the treebuilder code",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:16): yep yep",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:16): OK, that is good news",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:16): or good for me to get confirmation of that",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:16): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: fun with RDFa, eh?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:16): you guessed it man",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:17): xmlns is deprecated in RDFa 1.1",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:17): however, the spec currently says, &quot;Conformance checkers must accept attribute names that have a case insensitive prefix matching &quot;xmlns:&quot; as conforming. Conformance checkers should generate warnings noting that the use of xmlns: is deprecated.&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:17): yeah",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:17): agreed",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:20): if anything that part of the spec should be changed to say, &quot;Conformance checkers may report xmlns attributes as errors&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:20): anyway, it's also not clear whether xmlns is an error in RDFa Lite or not",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:20): not clear to me anyway",
