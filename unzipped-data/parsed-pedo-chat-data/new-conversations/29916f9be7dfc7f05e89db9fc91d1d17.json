That compares to the common scenario before where there was at most 1Gbps network adapter than was used for all network access including the NetApps disk storage.",

The benefit for the migration is not getting into a situation where some hosts are perenially overloaded while others sit idle.",

I think the perceptions people have built up about VMs might be out of date when they are deployed properly. I think there is a good chance for a win for you guys."
