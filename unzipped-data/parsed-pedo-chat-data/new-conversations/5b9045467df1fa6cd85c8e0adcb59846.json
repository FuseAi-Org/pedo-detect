        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:24): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: \u201a\u00dc\u00eb",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:26): by non-empty I mean that clearly hte expectation of the PF about UA behavior is something more than what the PF have put in the spec",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:27): It seems like it would be useful to have a discussion with RichS and Michael Cooper about what needs to be added to the spec",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:27): (they're the editors, as I recall)",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:28): maybe aaronlev can help with making it clear what needs to be done, as far as spec'ing out the UA conformance criteria",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:28): there has been progress on stuff getting written down",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:29): but it's written down outside the document that is being advanced along the REC track",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:30): well, then it seems like that needs to be incorporated into the actual spec",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:30): 1d3bfcfde5ac540a616a25dff751e36f: I don't have strong opinion on the title of the document that lays out the criteria",
        "1d3bfcfde5ac540a616a25dff751e36f (12:30): so it dosn't need to be in the spec?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:30): but if it's not the ARIA spec, then HTML5 should probably reference the doc that actually contains the info",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:33): I haven't followed exactly, but it seems that if the ARIA spec does not actually define ARIA it's mostly moot",
