        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (03:45): man... I so prefered bigendian cpu's... *sigh*",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:46): Moridin8: what are you up to?",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:47): its possible to reference an .exe right?",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:47): so i should make all the types in that assembly be internal so the &quot;average&quot; coder cant get into it?",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (03:47): I hate the way x86 CPU's do their byte order in memory... (messing with pointers)",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:48): AnarkiNet: what is your goal?",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (03:48): in an int, x86 stores the vaue 1 this:   01 00 00 00",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:48): well",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:48): its a closed source commercial application",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (03:48): with 68k... 1 would be stored thus:  00 00 00 01",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:48): I try to avoid writing code where I can tell the difference",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (03:48): makes more sense",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:48): AnarkiNet: are you using multiple assemblies?",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:48): yeah",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:48): well",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:48): theres LibMUSE",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:49): which contains all the free stuff",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:49): so presumably you must have public members in those assemblies?",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:49): yes",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:49): but i'm talking about the .exe",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:49): not the dll",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:49): personally I wouldn't bother",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:49): the library is obviously full of public members",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:49): well",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:49): ildasm/ilasm isn't very difficult",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:49): hmm",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:49): unless you are going to go with some additional other protection",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:50): e.g. a decent obfuscator",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:50): should i sign my assemblies?",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (03:50): anarki: always",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:50): there's no real reason not to",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:51): well, basically i want both the server and the class library to be freely usable for non commercial purposes but i need a way to keep a company from using it without paying",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:51): you can use licensing",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:51): which stops your assemblies working on unauthorised computers",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (03:51): Anarki:  yeh good luck",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:51): hmmm",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:51): and as long as only you can authorise machines, they can't distribute",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:52): someone who cares enough can of course break this",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:52): the other thing i was thinking of would be to not release the server executable at all",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:52): but same goes for any code in any language",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (03:52): &lt;-- like me",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:52): right",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:52): yeah, i'm not going to worry about absolute 100% lockdown",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:52): AnarkiNet: arguably the best way to deal with this is to sue anyone who tries",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:53): i fully understand the &quot;any electronic security system can be breached&quot; fact",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:53): but then i'll need a phone-home built into the dll or something :P",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:53): if you don't notice it, why does it matter?",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:53): and if you do notice it, then you've noticed",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:53): well",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:53): my project is a development tool",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:53): so its hard to notice if a company is using it behind closed doors without consent",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:54): unless for example an audit is done of the company's machines or something",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:54): that's not the same as them calling your internal methods though",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:54): that's them using your code without licenses",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:54): hmm",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:54): well, i'm somewhat new to commercial software, heh",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:55): a common solution is Xheo",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:55): all my projects before have been open source",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:55): I've used it, it's ok",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:55): what does your product do btw?",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:55): its a multi-user editing engine",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:55): simultaneous?",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:55): yes",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:55): nice",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:55): but its being designed to be not restricted to text",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:56): which is what everything i've been able to find before has been restricted too",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:56): MVC?",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:56): to*",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:56): eh?",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:56): is it model view controller based?",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:56): er",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:56): i dont know what that is, so probably not",
        "502458c06721a62682c0c840229afaf1 (03:56): i have a form where you have to enter some info and I want it to activate a button when the user hits enter.. is there an easy way to do this?",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:57): are you happy to talk about the design behind it?",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:57): [BAF64]: set the button's Default property to true",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (03:57): Theory, yeah, i'm going to document all that pretty extensively",
        "5677ca358f85d384f7b12e9f5cfbb27d (03:57): [BAF64]: sorry, I think it's the form's AcceptButton property",
        "502458c06721a62682c0c840229afaf1 (03:58): hmm",
        "502458c06721a62682c0c840229afaf1 (03:58): aha, thanks"
