        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:37): I reverted a revert in response to the yes. :/",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (06:37): reversion ftw",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:38): &quot;Reverted a revert (I must not go derper).&quot;",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:39): Now I use -1 to 1 of the amplitude range",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:39): instead of 0 to 1",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:40): I had used 0 to 1 previously because drop-offs were less noticeable with that range",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:40): but utilizing -1 to 0 doubles the volume/ :D",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:41): though this is not what real gameboy hardware does",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:41): Gameboys only have a positive scale amplitude",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:41): but this doesn't matter, because computer speakers are much way better quality",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:42): so the low pass attribute natural to a positive scale is unrelated even to when I was using it",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:42): and computer OSes apply such a filter anyhow usually",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:42): I hope. :P",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:44): notes instead of the amplitude going from 0 to 1, it now goes from -1 to 1, which means natural filter effects from speakers themselves apply differently in this case.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:44): so the sound may marginally be different if you have shitty speakers",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:44): let me know when it goes to 11 :D",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:44): or your OS does weird shit",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:45): 0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17: ^_^",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:45): notes that for most of the time, the amplitude will actually be somewhere between -1 and 0 now",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:46): is throwing your computer speakers' magnets in reverse",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:46): nooooo",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:46): ok",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:47): 0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17: Because each audio channel (total of 4) gets at most an amplitude of 0.5",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:47): ahh",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:48): And I adjust by subtracting -1 from the running total",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:48): well then.....technically make it 10, but label it 11 :D",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:48): theoretically",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:48): so it goes from 0-2 to -1-1",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:48): even if it's technically 1",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:48): yeah, i'm just being dumb, don't mind me",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:48): 0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17: I don't even know why I'm discussing this here. :/",

        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (06:49): sunday night an bored?",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:49): yesh",
        "c22cc4227c3fd1380b44a8169f85c844 (06:49): he's trying to show off to get you in the sack",

        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:50): Any talk like that belongs in #reddit",
        "c22cc4227c3fd1380b44a8169f85c844 (06:50): or #bearcave on EFnet",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:50): I wonder how you know...",

        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:51): #html5 != #reddit != what ever #bearcave is",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:53): 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: There might be a decimal point round up problem potentially causing volume for one of my audio channels to just barely get over 0.50 amplitude",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:53): and if all channels do 0.50 with the one with &quot;a little extra from FPU round up&quot; then I might get an amplitude like 1.00000000000000001",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:53): I doubt that will mess up webkit audio",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:54): Because I believe these audio apis clip any amplitude beyond -1-1",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (06:54): so anything above 1 equals 1",

        "c22cc4227c3fd1380b44a8169f85c844 (06:55): grant, why did you switch from 0 1 to -1 1",
