        "c16262cca8cd40ad606e6920ac1a816a (10:33): best advice... instead of sinking more money in trying to 'fix' it.. just replace it then.. if it has progressivly gotten worse...",
        "c16262cca8cd40ad606e6920ac1a816a (10:34): by the time you get it diagnosed, and fixed.. you probably could have bought 2 or more new m/b's",

        "c16262cca8cd40ad606e6920ac1a816a (10:37): instead of the frustrations, time, and money of trying to fix it and keep it running... i am gonna just replace it this summer....",
