        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:08): it has intel wireless (linux kernel support), ac97 audio, etc",

        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:08): it's like an ibm.  The widescreen needs a VBIOS patch but besides that it's all good",
        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:08): core duos = faster + $",

        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:15): for a cheap computer it's VERY nice",
        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:16): the only downside I've found is that xine and the XVideo extension do not work well with the intel 915...in fact not with the 830+, really",
        "6a702c604058bea73648584db122537b (16:16): I was looking at this: <a href=\"http://www.pc.ibm.com/us/notebooks/thinkpad/x-series/index.html\">http://www.pc.ibm.com/us/notebooks/thinkpad/x-series/index.html</a> but can buy 3 b130's for that :)",
        "6a702c604058bea73648584db122537b (16:17): Shirakawasuna, ah that's too bad, however I don't really need super graphics also, intel had linux drivers, but last time I looked they where last released in 2000 ?",
        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:18): they're fine",
        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:18): it's just a xine libXv bug",
        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:18): I get good fps and can play some basic 3d games, etc",
        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:18): electricsheep looks wonderful",

        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:28): I actually don't run it much anymore on the lappy because folding@home takes too much cpu for electricsheep to still look good",
        "874283016434bdfa1caa162b7fe7a5d2 (16:28): on my desktop I can run electricsheep and folding@home at the same time, though",
        "a9a6bd2cd664a685ecbac33d6bece9e0 (16:29): Shirakawasuna: the crazy part is that the owners didn't mod the cases, that's the wey they bought them",
        "6a702c604058bea73648584db122537b (16:29): hm, how about using javascript btw, to let unaware clients participate in things like electricsheep :p",
