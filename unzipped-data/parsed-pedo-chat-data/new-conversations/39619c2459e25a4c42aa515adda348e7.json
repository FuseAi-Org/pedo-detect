        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:20): that's 'rdfa in xhtml'; nobody is asking HTML5 to be XML-only. So I think this leaves the door open for figuring out which bits of it could be re-built on top of html5 without too much trauma",
        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:20): eg. a profile without using curies",

        "952fcd570c09b3137446717c00bcbdd6 (10:26): sure, so we are really starting from scratch then, right?",
        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:26): the rdfa spec tries to be a design that can be bound to specific concrete carrier languages (svg, atom, xhtml, ...)",
        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:27): binding to a non-xml language is more of a stretch; since you need to invent or avoid having a ns abbreviation mechanism",
        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:27): most of the dicussion to date has been around this re-inventing a ns prefixing mechanism",

        "952fcd570c09b3137446717c00bcbdd6 (10:31): ...and people using xhtml in the future will be using xhtml5, not xhtml1, so unfortunately that spec we mentioned has no real value",
        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:31): so would you agree it was useful for me to spend my yesterday trying out rdfa tool support for a namespaces-free profile of rdfa?",
        "952fcd570c09b3137446717c00bcbdd6 (10:31): I think that's a step forward",

        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:32): unfortunately it seems the parsers mostly work on the html5 no-ns version, but so long as they find a magic hack,  xmlns:http=&quot;http:&quot;",
        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:33): henri said it's easier to make the validator tolerate this than to have it check real use of xml namespaces; but i hope we can approach from the other side too, and have rdf parsers not look for it",
        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (10:34): this would give a copy-and-paste-friendly profile of rdfa: subsets which, with some care, could be copy/pasted between html5 and xhtml5/atom/svg docs",

        "952fcd570c09b3137446717c00bcbdd6 (10:41): actually, I don't think I've seen a concrete proposal put forward from the RDFa guys, I saw something about adding six attributes",
