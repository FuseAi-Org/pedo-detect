        "cb4b88d06a8e0e3bd2710103a9d46b81 (08:09): probably freezes randomly while running.  I used to have that happen sometimes in ut2004",

        "01c6319be611d96562d876d94c32c4ef (08:10): is there any way to calculate what memory speed you need to avoid a bottleneck",
        "cb4b88d06a8e0e3bd2710103a9d46b81 (08:14): Tarantulafudge, what exactly are you going to use the hardware for?",
        "01c6319be611d96562d876d94c32c4ef (08:14): ahlfors, I just don't want a bottleneck, but I don't want to buy the highest possible memory speed",
        "01c6319be611d96562d876d94c32c4ef (08:15): ahlfors, going for cheep",

I'm trying to get it to live, but I'm getting no signal on sleeping VGA monitors and fuzzy lines over nothing/BIOS on non-sleeping ones.",
        "01c6319be611d96562d876d94c32c4ef (08:18): ahlfors, amd athlon 64 x2 uses the am2 socket and therefore ddr2 memory",

I'm trying to cram a MicroATX into it right now, but it's not fitting very nicely.",

        "44a8b7e0a871f0aaa9409140a1ab0b00 (08:22): err large enough i mean",
        "cb4b88d06a8e0e3bd2710103a9d46b81 (08:23): I don't know for sure, but RAM bottleneck is not that common unless your RAM and CPU are badly mismatched.",
        "cb4b88d06a8e0e3bd2710103a9d46b81 (08:23): even less likely on AMD compared to Intel.",

        "44a8b7e0a871f0aaa9409140a1ab0b00 (08:38): what kind of video interface does that even use",

        "bdc896cddbeff32b9e37457d11cdb560 (08:41): Draconicus: you'll need to do some serious modding to make it work. Good luck, sounds like an awesome project. I should've done just that to my old dead Model 57 486SLC2/66.",
        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (08:55): silverpower: Not really... I just need to drill some holes, put in some risers, mount it all up and use some extension cables to connect the back ports. o.O",

        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (08:57): tricky*",
        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (08:59): Also, I have a new, important question: What purpose do the extra four pins on the additional plug with newer motherboards serve? Does it supply vital power or optional? Can a system with a light accelerated PCI video card and a large CPU fan survive without it?",
        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (09:01): I can't fit a standard ATX PSU into the case along with my P4 MicroATX Foxconn board. They don't make oddly shaped new ones, and the only ATX PSU I have that fits obviously lacks the extra four-pin plug.",
        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (09:02): It's a 300w out of an old Gateway... I don't know if it'd do the trick.",
        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (09:04): I'm not used to it. Just looked it up. Apparently it's vital with P4 systems.",

        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (09:15): It'll be about $25 with shipping.",

        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (09:44): Seems the beeping board didn't like my PIII. Either it can't handle it (odd for 1998), or the PIII is dead.",
        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (09:44): Who knows. That plan's ruined, though.",
        "15a9b69698731f11a211adc621ec9a2c (09:52): Wow. IBM's probably the only company dumb enough to make a BIOS that gives an error if there's no mouse plugged in.",
