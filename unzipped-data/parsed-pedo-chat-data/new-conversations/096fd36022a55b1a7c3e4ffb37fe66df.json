        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:38): Like runtests.py and runparsertests.py just throw errors now",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (13:40): now you're just being picky",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:51): Oh, did I commit that?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:52): Well, having the tests running in nose is a huge win for sanity",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:54): So think of it an an impetus to make the other tests work properly (i.e. in nose)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (14:14): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: See, I'm still not sure it's much of a win, and breaking it is just annoying.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:14): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: I am entirely sure it is 100% win",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (14:15): wants a receieve hook that rejects anything that regresses any testcase",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:15): No",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:16): Apart from anything else it would quickly get complicated",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:16): Imagine someone adding a TC that we fail. Why would one reject other pushes for failing to address that?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:17): So you would either need to make people add annotations like &quot;expected fail&quot; that the commit hook would ignore",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:17): (+ to indicate TC fails)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:17): Or keep a list of known passes/fails",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (14:18): you could reimplement spartan for html5lib",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:18): Doing that once is enough I think :p",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:24): Have a receive hook that sends a warning message to IRC on test failures, so people can apply their own judgement and decide whether to tell off the committer",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:25): suggests lack of infrastructure is not the main problem",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (14:26): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, but the tools will save us!",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:28): If by &quot;tools&quot; you mean &quot;street corner preachers&quot; and &quot;save us&quot; you mean &quot;convert us to Jesus&quot; then I still have my doubts",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (14:29): well you kinda look like Jesus anyway :)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:29): dr Jesus",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:31): notes that if Jesus looked like him, he would have stuck out like a sore thumb in the middle east",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (14:32): Like you with a tan, perhaps?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:35): I'm not sure I get tans, just more pronounced freckles",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:36): http://i.imgur.com/JVI4V.jpg and even so, within half an hour you're in the mountains",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:44): I *think* I've seen Zeldman show a CSS example that included an unprefixed CSS property in anticipation of the property getting standardized in the future",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:44): now I can't find such an example on this blog",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:47): I meant that Tokyo is so vast, and even so it's pretty easy to get to the mountains",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:50): whenever such an insert happens a &quot;MutationRecord&quot; is created if there are appropriate listeners",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:50): MutationRecord are not really created in a smart way otherwise",
