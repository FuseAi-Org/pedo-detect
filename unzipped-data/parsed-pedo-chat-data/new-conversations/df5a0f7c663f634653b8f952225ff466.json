        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:06): it seems like there are as many reasons to send cookies as to not send cookies, and that there is fear in both directions",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:06): so we need to clearly look at what the various fears _are_, and work out how to mitigate them",
