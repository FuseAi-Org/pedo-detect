        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (05:17): 'cause we like being fancy, obviously.  And using HTML5 to the fullest is fancy.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (05:22): Well, you don't have to add it at every use.  It's a once-per-page think, just like the createElement hack.  But it's one that can't be externalized to a &lt;script&gt;, which is really annoying.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (05:27): will test, but if he needs to go ahead and use a different approach already, he might as well know.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (05:28): Yeah it can be, but the hacks to reliably detect IE6 and 7 are sorta weird.  I guess Dean Edwards's stuff works pretty well.",
