        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (16:53): Yes, I am. I had a teleconf with the Mobile Web Test Suites WG and we decided on editorial changes that needed to be made to the P&amp;C to make it testable",
        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (16:54): I guess minutes from the teleconf must be available in the MWTS archives. You may recall, this was also the agreement that we had with Dom as part of his Last Call comments. The changes include...",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (16:54): did you fork the spec?",
        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (16:55): Artb, not yet (as I have not checked in the changes). But I will.",
