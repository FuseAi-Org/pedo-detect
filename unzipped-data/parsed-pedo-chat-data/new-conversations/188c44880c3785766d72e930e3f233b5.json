        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:44): oh, then whoever implemented it there should be able to provide some description of what it does and how it works",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:45): when you submit a form that contains it it starts an async process that generates a key",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:50): so presumably, servers are supposed to be able to encrypt data using that public key and send it back to the browser",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:54): well, the lack of a standard mechanism for digital signing in browsers is on thing that causes browser lock-in in some places",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:54): i just know it's supported in some form of interop between Safari / Firefox / Opera",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:56): anway, Korean banks and government sites use digital signing quite a lot, but they rely on an ActiveX control for doing it",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:17): I wonder if Dirac could be implemented on Rockbox or iPodLinux.  I read somewhere that Theora can't be due to memory and/or processing contstraints",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (14:20): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: is it that bad? Rockbox has support for MPEG on players without video decoder circuitry (on the ipod nano, for instance)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:20): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: the technical problem with avoiding the base techniques of the MPEG family is that the hardware DSP chips accelerate the operations needed for MPEG",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:22): so are you saying that since Dirac won't have the hardware support like MPEG, then it's unlikely?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:23): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I am saying that existing MPEG-oriented hardware probably won't be particularly useful for accelerating Theora or Dirac",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:24): ok",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:24): (but then, some DSP chips really suck. on Nokia 770, MPEG-4 ASP decoding works better on the CPU than on the DSP)"
