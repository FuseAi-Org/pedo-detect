        "f7e6971dbbdfff2fb82151f934d183a6 (14:36): i bought a new pc, including a sapphire ati radeon 1900xt",
        "f7e6971dbbdfff2fb82151f934d183a6 (14:36): in its specs it said the gpu would run with a frequency of 625 MHz",
        "f7e6971dbbdfff2fb82151f934d183a6 (14:37): but the ati control center only shows 500 and a requested value",
        "f7e6971dbbdfff2fb82151f934d183a6 (14:37): ok, i'm fine with that, but what i can't believe is the frequency of the dram",
        "f7e6971dbbdfff2fb82151f934d183a6 (14:37): in the specs it said: 1450 MHz DDR3",
        "f7e6971dbbdfff2fb82151f934d183a6 (14:37): but the ati controlcenter lists it as 720 MHz",
        "f7e6971dbbdfff2fb82151f934d183a6 (14:37): why is that so?",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (14:43): I dunno but feel free to hang out here till you find out",

        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (14:50): does athlon 64 venice core support dual channel?",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (14:50): (memory)",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (14:50): I think so",

        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (14:50): mine works on a single channel for some reason",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (14:51): it exists",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (14:51): there's a channel for everything here",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (14:54): bbl",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:07): Bog: yes it does",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:07): makesure your dimm geomerty is the same on both dimms...",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:09): geometry?",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:12): the same number and size of ram chips ie 4x64",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (15:13): best to buy matched sets",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:13): cause 4x64 and 2x128 dimms won't dual channel (btw those numbers are totally arbatry and I'm sure not valid dimm geometrys",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:14): yeah if you don't know what you're doing but often non-matched sets are cheaper...",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:15): oh",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:16): no... one has 8, one has 16",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:16): thanks, that solves the problem",

        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (15:16): that was kinda dumb to say",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:17): i bought one a long time ago",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:17): and one not that long ago",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:18): flyback-: not really often buying a 2GB matched set is more expencive than buying 2x 'non-matched' dimms :p",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (15:18): it has nothing to do with fucking not knowing what you are doing",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (15:18): sometimes people just don't want to be bothered",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:19): so you buy matched sets and pay a -10 to +10% price diffrene",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:19): i don't really wanna spend money on more ram now",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:20): if you know what you're doing you don't need to buy matched sets if it's not to your advantage.. if you cba/don't know matched sets more-or-less guarentees you get working dual channel ram",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (15:21): bah I think someone is suffering from pompus ass symdrome",

        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:21): I think someone is suffering from stupidity personally",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:22): i don't understand what you two are arguing about",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:23): Bog: you can buy 'matched sets' which is two dimms that have 'identical' specifications...",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:23): i know",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:23): i can buy anything",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (15:23): yeah he's a jew, he steals everyone's money",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:24): depending on the company matched sets can be 10% less to 10% more",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (15:24): :P",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:24): the fact is that there are no more ram sticks with 16 chips",

        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:24): 16 chips for how much ram?",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:24): 512",
        "27d26e2f0adc9343a424c1d19941386b (15:25): anyways need more sleep bbl",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:25): yeah that's very low densety stuff",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:25): I think I've got some 4 chip 512MB dimms",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:26): i haven't seen one",
        "aec8097f41d57dd488e4a05f06db218d (15:26): will my pc work much better with dual channel memory?",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:28): it'll have faster I/O through put to memory.. depends what you're doing...",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:28): ahh they're fast server dimms",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:29): 512MB is the smallest they come in so I asuume the chips they use are 128",
        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (15:29): anyway gtg do some work...",
