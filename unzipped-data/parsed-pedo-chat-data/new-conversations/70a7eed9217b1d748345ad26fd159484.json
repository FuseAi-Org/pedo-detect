        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:10): I thought XHTML replaced HTML as like a new version.",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:11): d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: http://blog.whatwg.org/faq/ might help (although it doesn't really cover in detail what you're asking about yet :( ...)",
        "50f88044f12dac51f8a48d6528d71c85 (00:12): d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: xhtml was never really meant to replace html; it's a common misconception :(",
        "3e1c1074b5072fb0e507ed33291ed9b1 (00:13): maybe here http://xhtml.com/en/future/conversation-with-x-html-5-team/ are some basic principles described",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:14): d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: but in any case, html5 has an xml serialization as well should you want to use it",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:15): (referred to as xhtml5)",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:15): ic.. well I don't really use any xml",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:16): thank you for the links.",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:16): ok. then presumably the xml serialization is less interesting to you than the text/html serialization",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:20): hmm.. I really need to learn about this stuff. Does the w3c decide what can and cant be used for web development?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:20): d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: does the w3c endorce flash?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:21): s/endorce/endorse/",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:21): ah yeah",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:21): so, what do they do exactly?",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:21): just provide nice buttons for your websites?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:22): no",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:22): &quot;w3c&quot; is mostly a name aiui. then there are many working groups working on different things",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:23): e.g. a new html wg was chartered recently to work on the same thing that the whatwg are working on, basically",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:23): http://www.w3.org/html/wg/",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:24): so two seperate groups are working on the same thing?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:25): it hasn't been decided formally yet what the htmlwg will be doing, but taking the whatwg proposals as a starting point is the only real proposal that has been put forward",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:25): though the charter is very similar to the whatwg proposals, so presumably that is the intent",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:25): ah ic. so if the whatwg proposal is accepted will they begin working with them?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:26): yes",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:26): hopefully it will be one and the same spec with the same editors that are part of both groups",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:27): (i and many others here are members of both groups)",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:28): so whats this for http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:29): d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: the xhtml2 wg's home page",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:31): yeah but why is there a xhtml2 and a (x)html5",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:33): d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88: because the people in the xhtml2 wg (the old html wg) had a different vision of the future of the web than the vision of opera, mozilla and apple",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:34): So does that mean xhtml2 will never be implemented into a browser?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:35): well, aiui opera, mozilla and apple are not interested in implementing xhtml2",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:35): microsoft have bigger fish to fry",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:36): what do you mean by that? whats microsoft up to?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:36): microsoft are chairing the html wg, but i don't know what their plans are wrt xhtml2 (i would presume they won't implement xhtml2 anytime soon)",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:37): (or at all)",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:37): I've never gotten anything to work with IE anyway.",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:38): I signed upto the forums. its a bit of a ghost town. I would of thought it would be full of web developers",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:39): the forums are not so old",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:39): but feel free to ask questions there",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:39): ah Ic. whats with the skinny author column in viewtopic",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:41): um. dunno. probably because it's not in quirks mode",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:41): And no avatars!",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:41): you want avatars?",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:42): yeah, it so much easier to remember somebody with an image rather than there name.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:43): It should be just the quality of the message that is important, not who wrote it ;-)",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:44): anyone here against avatars?",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:44): yeah but if someone has written several quality messages you are more inclined to listen to their opinion",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:45): thinks they do make it easier to follow a discussion",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:45): enabled",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:46): (It's like in IRC when there's a discussion between people whose names are the same length, and you can't tell who's who without actually reading all the letters, which is irritating)",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:48): ok.. now to find/make an avatar",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:50): oh my god...",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:51): I've always questioned that trailing slash",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (00:53): Some clients assign random colors to each nick to separate them, but it might get too intense",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:54): X-Chat Aqua does that",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (00:57): yo... this may be a stupid question but in html5 if you just wrote &lt;div&gt; and didn't have a &lt;/div&gt; anywhere would it treat it as a void div.. or would it just not work",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:58): It would work the same as in current HTML",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:59): (The whole parsing algorithm is designed to be compatible with what browsers currently implement)",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:01): Is it a bad thing to have an empty div? because sometimes (actually quite alot) I use divs purely for presentational purposes",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (01:02): an empty div for presentational purposes is mostly harmless",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:03): mostly...?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (01:03): but using html for presentational purposes in general is not what html is designed to do",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:03): (...but a &lt;div&gt; without a matching &lt;/div&gt; is an error and makes the document non-conforming, regardless of how it's parsed)",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:04): so can you write it as &quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot; or does it have to be &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (01:04): the latter",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:04): why?",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:04): if theres nothing in it why does it need the &lt;/div&gt;",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (01:05): because otherwise everything after it will be children of the div",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (01:06): e.g. compare &quot;&lt;div&gt;X&quot; with &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;X&quot;",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:06): oh ok, it just looks a little silly is all",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:08): do you gentlemen mind if I show off my latest design to you?",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:08): its written in xhtml tho.. with the &lt;br /&gt;s so I hope none get offended",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:09): I think the people here don't mind much about impure language usage - that's why we're not working on XHTML :-)",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:10): its um still a work in progress",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:10): http://www.michaelmh.com/stuff/JimKing/",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:11): its a bit iffy in opera with the drop down color change bit. and it basically explodes in IE. should be fine in Firefox and Safari",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:12): i'm a newbie to javascript and php tho so the color change thing might be a bit iffy too",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:14): who picked pink?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:16): looks innocent",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:17): do you like whole one area controlled by the page scroll bar thing going on?",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:18): purple...",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:19): fails to break the code :-(",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:19): what did you do?",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:19): I was scared of someone breaking it. it validates both client side and server side",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:20): Maybe it'd be nice if that area could expand to fill the screen, since it's otherwise fairly tiny in the middle of a big screen - I have no idea how to implement that, though",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:20): (It also breaks really badly in Firefox 3 when scrolling, since everything jumps around until it's redrawn the whole screen, but maybe they'll fix that eventually)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:22): Otherwise I think it looks good, particularly with the faint shadows :-)",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:25): :D thanks. I'm really chuffed with the code too. I literally just started learning javascript two days ago (and consequently php since I need to validate the info client side and write it to a file.) and i coded the bit which checks the brightness of the colour. I nicked the thing that checks whether or not the value is hex tho, I couldnt fiqure out how to do that",
        "d5e0b073765cd0a45ace9f843b8eaf88 (01:30): well gtg. I'll come back on tommoro with new questions once I've read all this stuff.",
