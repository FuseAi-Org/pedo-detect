        "c8e7f46a8a672001016ce354ffe822b0 (12:29): like the lights will get power on the network card, but it won't read in device manager, and now the mouse isn't working, but earlier the pci network card wasn't getting anything, but now i switch it",
        "c8e7f46a8a672001016ce354ffe822b0 (12:30): but the nic card is lighting up, but don't get detected by device manager",
