        "ab43fbf40c1404aee0e199bf992a2d98 (13:01): or do i have to write one myself",

        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (13:04): it also has an aliteration with &quot;awful&quot;",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:12): eving/morning all",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:13): anyone know how i can get the mouseMove delta in the mouseMove event?  the e.delta seems to only cover the mouseWheel",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:13): i need a frame by frame mouseMove delta",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:17): anyone? ...beuler?",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:21): you'd have to record the previous position and work it out from that",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:22): how do i do that frame by frame?",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:23): what do you mean frame-by-frame? mousemove is triggered when the mouse moves (hence the name :P) so each time it moves see if there is a previous value, if there is, work out the difference",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:24): well, mouse sample to mouse sample",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (13:25): delta is just defined as change/time",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (13:25): so figure out how far it moves in a given time",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (13:25): then divide (for the sake of argument) by 60",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:26): hmm...ok..i think i get it..lemme quickly test",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (13:26): I'm sure you could get the refresh rate for more specific",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (13:27): but... unless you're doing some freaky game mechanics, I don't see why you'd care about frames",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:27): i guess implementing it with timers would be too resource intensive",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (13:27): w-h: depends on how often it's sampled",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:27): indeed",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:27): but seeing as we are talking refresh rate levels",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:27): we..every mouseMove event triggers a UI redraw....so i think i can do it in there....",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:27): i assume it would be",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:28): yeah",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (13:28): sedric: I'm still curious as to why you care about per frame",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:28): sedric - just record DateTime.Now between each MouseMove",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:28): then you can get the time",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:28): however, does mousemove trigger on every pixel?",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:28): well, saying perframe might not be accurate...more like per-redraw...and because redraw is driven my mouseMove...permouseMove",
        "d53a9ce77f40534cd0a1ee00cb6b8f3f (13:29): because if so then the distance will always be 1",
        "d62fd5329a154ecd79da3857ce103fb6 (13:29): no, just updates a bunch of bezier lines",

        "1cf2e819eddaaff3d5bbea26ffb4f526 (13:30): or evening to you",
