        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:16): with 900mhz yagis do you aim it so that the single vertical main strut is parrallel to the target, or so that the elements are perpendicular to the target?",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:17): how far is the link variable_office ?",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:18): 4ft -- just testing in the office now",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:18): lol",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:18): tommorrow i am going to test on a 2mi link with 500-1500 ft of trees",

        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:18): and again on 100ft of trees",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:18): good luck with that",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:18): so we shall see",

        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:19): Pablo you know how to aim a 900mhz yagi?",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:19): yeah",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:19): whats are you aiming at?",

        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:20): they should be the same way",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:20): so that the main strut is aimed at each other correct?",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:21): yes",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:21): ok, thats what i figured",

        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:23): even the 100ft of trees?",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:23): would not outperform an sr2",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:23): but maybe they fixed it",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:23): really? crazy",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:23): thatd really suck",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:24): then id have to go canopy or something for the in-trees peopel",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:24): that was months before they were released",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:24): ah",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:24): i plan on doing 5mhz nstreme",

        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:24): that works really good",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:24): we used dual polarity feedhorns",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:24): 5mhz nstreme does? have you done it before?",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:25): and could get 22Mbps both ways same time",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:25): at 12 miles",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:25): with 5mhz?",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:25): with 3 foot dishes",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:25): or 20mhz?",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:25): yes",

        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:25): yeah... but I think you will have just as good of lick with cm9",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:25): luck",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:26): so was this nstreme2, as in you were running 2 cards per side?",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:26): yes",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:26): do you know if anyone has tried to replicate that carzy 300+mbps nstreme setup?",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (09:26): *crazy",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:27): i  have never seen any peformance like that",
        "eaa6e1da0eef72dfb27f73d1b6493b8f (09:27): 22mbit was what we could truly get at 12 miles",
