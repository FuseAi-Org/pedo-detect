        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:19): if an event has a cover charge, would it be appropriate to note down the cost using the adapted version of XRBL noted in http://microformats.org/wiki/currency-formats , or is there some part of hCalendar I've missed ?",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:21): fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403: There's no pricing/cost field in Calendar",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:21): So you'd have to just include it as part of the event `description`",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:22): The currency formats stuff is just brainstorming and examples gathering at this point",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:22): So there's no standard for it",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:23): The closest we have is &lt;foo class=&quot;price&quot;&gt;\u00ac\u00a315&lt;/span&gt; which is used in hListing, which is a little more mature.",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:23): is considering using &lt;abbr class=&quot;price&quot; title=&quot;0&quot;&gt;free&lt;/abbr&gt; for free events",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:23): I'm not sure that makes a lot of sense as an abbreviation.",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:24): the general usage of abbr in microformats is to allow human-readable and machine-readable versions of the same data within an element",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:25): Not quite",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:25): &quot;free&quot; seems to be easier to isntantly understand than seeing stuff like $0",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:25): See http://microformats.org/wiki/machine-data",

        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:25): the ABBR pattern is suitable for some situations, but the semantics of HTML still apply",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:26): The content of both the title attribute and the inner text has to be human consumable, and it needs to make semantic sense as an abbreviation at the HTML level",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:27): hrm. i suppose if a parser was aware that all events on a website had a cover charge, that the absence of a price element would indicate the event was free",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:27): Basically, both title and inner text are human-data, but the title may also be a precise format of data so that machines can parse it too.",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:27): Now, in this case, there's no format for parsing prices",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:28): would prefer to use something, rather than nothing",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:28): There's no microformat. So to have the price included as part of the hCalendar content, you need to ensure that it's within the `description` field of the event.",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:28): Within that, using class=price makes as much sense as anything (and reuses the classname from hListing)",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:30): hrm.",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:32): is going to be including sentences such as &quot;This is a {price}, {rating}-rated {category} event, hosted by {host}&quot;",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:32): I'm noticing that the organizer only gets a very brief mention in the spec",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:33): organizer is ideally an hCard for the person/company responsible for the event",

        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:34): one other thing. I'm noticing that PICS seems to have been a bit of a failure, don't suppose there's any other machine-readable means of indicating content is PG or not PG ?",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:34): Not that I'm aware of, I'm afraid",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:35): much point for a microformat, given that I think automated parental guidence software would probably do keyword searches of the content ?",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:35): Gotta disappear now. Good luck with your mark-up! If you do experiment with currency and cost mark-up, please add it to the appropriate examples/brainstorming page on the wiki for currency! :)",
        "fe5fc1e9bf60926e09f6f91b4e6df403 (12:36): will have about 1 million+ examples of hCalendar marked up with cover charges in a day or so. in theory, anyway",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:37): Content rating discussion has always got tangled up in minutiae over cultural interpretation, and whether you trust the site to rate itself and so on. There's probably brainstorming on the wiki somewhere",
        "c36007e9e959730e43769d37e2689c2b (12:37): Wow, that's quite a few! Can you say where?",
