        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:20): sure, but if you have a vote and 50 people say &quot;no&quot; and 2 people say &quot;yes&quot;, deciding that that means going the &quot;yes&quot; route is clearly not building consensus",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:21): it's building discontent, if anything",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:21): right",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:21): but I don't think any such decision has been made",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:22): what I see is a 47-10 disagreement, not consensus, and the will to keep exploring both leads",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:22): if Dan was to force the minority solution, yeah that would probably be an issue, I agree",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:22): &quot;The possibility of changing our charter was also not popular but Chris and I feel some obligation to pursue it regardless&quot; -- 2 vs 34, the 2s have it",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:22): really? have the chairs shown any will to *not* open the rechartering process?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:22): -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-cg/2007OctDec/0174.html",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:22): or to even consider that?",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:22): or to come up with some compromise?",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:23): how is any of this consensus building?",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:23): I don't know enough context, but I read &quot;feel obligation&quot; not &quot;feel like&quot;",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:24): I've seen them ask Members who asked for charter changes what changes they want",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:24): not the smartest thing to put it to the vote if there are some process rules that oblige them, granted",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:24): I haven't seem them talk to Members who oppose charter changes to explain their reasoning",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:24): I don't believe any process rule obliges them to recharter",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:24): and I don't believe that is their claim",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:25): has Dan explained what makes him &quot;feel obliged&quot;?",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:25): or have you asked him to detail his rationale",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:25): yes",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:25): both on this channel and privately",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:25): I have asked him",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:25): all he said is that we need Microsoft's and IBM's support",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:26): oliver: ok, more concretely: &quot;Release &quot;HTML 5&quot; specification as a W3C Working Draft?&quot; 43 yes vs 6 no, yet &quot;Chris Wilson and I decided the question does not carry&quot;",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:26): didn't explain how to do that without losing existing support",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:26): d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02: http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/wd11spec/results and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2007Nov/0097.html",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:26): that sounds regrettable",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:26): indeed",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:26): I've even made specific compromise proposals on publishing the spec and the charter issue",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:27): such as setting a future date for FPWD to give extra time for patent review",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:29): really has too little knowledge of the context to comment much, but it does sound like an annoying situation",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:29): I think I understand Dan's wish to keep everyone aboard, but one can't please all at the same time :/",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:29): well he's currently risking losing the most active participants",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (08:30): hear hear",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:30): yes, I see that. The most active are probably also the ones with more good will to make temporary compromises",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:31): well we'll see. he said he'd give us a binding timetable for when we'd publish the current spec as a FPWD before thursday 20th",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:31): so that's what i'm waiting for before making any decisions on what to do next.",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:32): sighs... patents are always a tough pill to swallow",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:33): hm?",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:33): I don't see that there is any patent issue here",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:33): the key issue is the patent review upon publication of a FPWD, isn't it?",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:33): other than the fact that patent review won't start until we publish FPWD",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:34): it's unclear to me how not having that patent review serves any purpose",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:34): I think the point is to make sure that everyone does that review",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:35): if a major actor stays out of the WG during that review, that would be a serious risk",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:35): but that's just my immediate understanding of the problem",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:35): a greater risk than not having the review?",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:35): or is there more I'm missing?",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:35): I really don't know",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:35): a greater risk than having the review later, or giving more time for it",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:36): I've proposed a defined amount of extra review time",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:36): not having the review would be terrible, IMHO",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:36): a Member can always leave temporarily and return on completion of their review",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:36): changing the charter has no effect on review",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:36): so it seems to be just a procedural delay tactic",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:36): yeah that seems to me to be the most optimal way of doing it -- just have any members who need more than 3 months to do their patent review leave the group temporarily",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:37): otherwise we just slow down all the other players",
        "d3ca5dde60f88db606021eeba2499c02 (08:39): that'd be a solution, I guess.",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:41): I also proposed extra time before publishing to allow review of the actual FPWD without anyone having to leave, as long as the amount of time is predefined"
