        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:50): adding this to canvas when canvas is so poorly implemented at this stage would be stupid",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:50): every browser is swimming in bugs and unimplemented features already",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:51): adding more stuff will just make it even less likely that we'll reach the sort of quality point we need for exiting CR",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (11:56): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: agreed, canvas is suffering from poor interoperability",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:01): which is interesting since in theory, canvas should be the area of the spec where you could get the most interop per unit of effort (because the back end imaging model is well understood and old)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:06): it's the area of the spec with the most interop, i think",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:06): but it would only get worse if we added more features at this stage, imho",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:06): i mean, if the vendors think we should, i'll bow to pressure, but it just seems stupid to me",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (12:10): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Some of the interop problems in canvas are a result of different interpretations of spec text, I believe",
        "3e1c1074b5072fb0e507ed33291ed9b1 (12:11): so we need some spec how to read the spec? 8-)",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (12:12): 3e1c1074b5072fb0e507ed33291ed9b1: you mean you want formal grammar for a spec language",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (12:12): good luck",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:12): the spec text is improving",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (12:12): indeed it is",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:13): 3e1c1074b5072fb0e507ed33291ed9b1: the spec already says that it should be read forwards, backwards and in pieces",
