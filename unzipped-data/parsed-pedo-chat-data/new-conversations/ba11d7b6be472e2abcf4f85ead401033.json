        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:40): &quot;The W3C says that they won't touch it anymore. &quot;XHTML is the future&quot;.&quot; - they seem to be changing their minds now - see http://www.w3.org/html/wg/",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:49): Depends on how you make the application",
