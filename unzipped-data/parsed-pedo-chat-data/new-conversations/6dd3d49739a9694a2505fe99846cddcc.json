        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:19): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, other browsers make the bullets overlap the floats",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:19): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, the bullet is always displaced from the first line by border+padding",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:19): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, but the line isn't moved to compensate",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:20): so the bullet are on the left of a left float?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:20): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, (see also the three messages I just sent to www-style about float-displace)",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:20): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, no, they overlap a left float",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:21): right but on which side though? left?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:21): they're a fixed distance (border + padding of the list item) from the right edge of the left float",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:22): it's the formula you'd want if you also had float-displace indenting the line",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:22): then i don't understand what you mean by &quot;the line isn't moved to compensate&quot;",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:23): except float-displace isn't indenting the line, so the bullet overlaps the float",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:23): Starting from the beginning, what other browsers do is position the bullet relative to the first line box of the block.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:23): or the place that said line box would start if there were one",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:24): that line box is flush against the float",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:24): looks for a testcase",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:24): i guess i don't understand how that differs from float-displace, given the right values of float-displace",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:25): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=302070",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:25): it's like everybody's doing the right thing, except without setting float-displace:line on list items",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:25): which means if we become consistent",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:25): we'll never be able to change that default",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:25): whereas now Mozilla is doing something that means float-displace:line would be a compromise between existing browsers",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:26): so people could move to that default",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:27): i have to admit finding it difficult to really care :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:27): i think we should introduce float-displace and the other property",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:27): well, float-displace as specced is rather broken",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:27): but it's easily fixable",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:27): but i've given up trying to make bert and fantasai see reason, so i'm not planning on trying to get any work done in the csswg any time soon",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:28): ok, I guess I'll back out my patch",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:28): what did your patch do?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:28): or most of it, anyway",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:28): it made Mozilla match the behavior of other browsers",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:28): where the bullets overlap the float",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:28): but we don't move blocks",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:30): isn't that one of the values of float-displace and company?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:30): moving blocks is, but it really sucks",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:30): I think we want to get rid of it, except for things that introduce new BFCs",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:30): where it would be the default",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:31): so what's wrong with the behaviour of other browsers?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:31): bullets overlap floats",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:31): pretty much any time they're next to floats",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:38): that does suck",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:38): So I don't think I have a good excuse for implementing float-displace this far after feature freeze.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:39): But I think I can leave most of what I fixed in.",

        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (05:50): but still back out the change removing -moz-float-edge: margin-box from li"
