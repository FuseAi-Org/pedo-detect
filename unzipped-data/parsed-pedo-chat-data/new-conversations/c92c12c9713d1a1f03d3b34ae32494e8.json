        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:05): when you come back: i was wondering what your ideas are more specifically with cdata sections and the content model flag in svg scope",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:08): on one hand, it's nice to have the same content model flag changes as legacy UAs, but that creates a problem with &lt;textArea&gt;. otoh, it's nice to have the same content model as in svg-in-xml, but that means we probably have to introduce cdata sections",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:10): authors are used to doing &quot;&lt;script&gt;//&lt;![CDATA[&quot; when working with both html and xhtml",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:16): also, using /&gt; syntax on elements that are (r)cdata in legacy UAs will mess up in legacy UAs",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:17): I don't think keeping the syntax indentical is realistic",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:17): to the same extent as between html and xhtml is realistic",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:18): that isn't either",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:19): um, now i don't follow",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:20): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: to be honest, I didn't think CDATA sections and legacy behavior of &lt;script&gt; and &lt;style&gt; through properly",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:21): well, HTML has (R)CDATA elements, XHTML has namespace prefixes, etc.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:21): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: it would be good to raise the issues you see on list",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:21): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: ok",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:21): I mean, XHTML has namespaces",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:22): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: ah. right. i mean that it's possible to have a document that parses into roughly the same thing for both cases",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:23): and, to the same extent as that is possible with html and xhtml, it is realistic to design the svg-in-text/html such that it would be possible with svg in html as well",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:23): it seems possible with b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9's proposal, e.g.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:25): I think I'd do it in a way that you switch to something called the &quot;SVG phase&quot; in the parser",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:25): and you go back to the &quot;in body phase&quot; (currently called body insertion mode iirc) the moment you hit &lt;foreignobject&gt;",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:25): you switch to &quot;SVG phase&quot; when you hit &lt;svg&gt;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:26): yep, makes sense",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:26): that would allow for &lt;svg:script&gt; to have different parsing rules even, if desirable",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:26): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: yeah.",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:27): but is it?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:27): no",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:27): but it is for &lt;textarea&gt; within &lt;svg&gt;",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:27): apparently",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:27): does SVG have its own textarea?",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:27): textArea, yes",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:28): it can contain elements",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:28): I didn't remember that",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:28): SVG 1.2",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:28): ah, never had even made it on my radar to be forgotten, then",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (18:29): it's a shape that contains text, aiui",
