        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:36): Microsoft just filed a bug on &lt;canvas&gt;: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9189",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:40): told them to :-)",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (19:44): Does anyone know if they'll be implementing it in IE9, or what?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:44): I assume they know, but nothing has been announced",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:45): Given the detail that they're reviewing the spec in, I assume it's because they're either implementing it or planning to implement it at some point in the future",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (19:45): I figured that much, but I wonder if it's for IE9 or 10.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (19:45): Actually, have they even announced when IE9 will be released?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (19:45): Even approximately?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:46): has no idea",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:09): was told to come here for html5 canvas inquires is that correct?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:10): 8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b, yes, this is one place you can ask about that.",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:16): i have a drawing program that works, fine but since it is a mobile, app it broke.  noticed line 7 of the following makes the code fail http://pastebin.com/fvRpPFeu",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:19): need to figure out how to not use &quot;context.beginPath();&quot;  but lines are still anti-aliased",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:19): 8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b: It's not clear what that code is meant to be doing",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:20): It sounds like you're calling it each time the user clicks somewhere?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:20): If you don't call beginPath, then every time you call lineTo you're making the current path get longer and longer",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:21): and each time you call stroke() you're re-drawing every line segment that's ever been added to that path",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (20:21): MikeSmith: am now",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:21): yes it is based o this code: http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/649/example1.js",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:21): which might be what makes it look non-antialiased (because it's overdrawing the lines)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:21): What you probably want is to do beginPath, and then moveTo with the *previous* mouse coordinates, and then lineTo with the current mouse coordinates",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:22): so that each time you're just drawing a single line between the previous and current mouse positions",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:23): Hmm, that example seems to do it wrong (it never resets so it'll stroke longer and longer paths)",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:24): the weird thing is that drawing works, without &quot;context.beginPath();&quot; but once uncommented, it fails to display",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:24): If you just call beginPath and then lineTo, it's not drawing a line from somewhere to somewhere",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:24): because you've only given it a single point",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:24): which is why you first need to moveTo the previous point",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:26): how would I moveTo previous point?",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:27): was chatting with another developer, and he said he does not even use &quot;context.beginPath();&quot;  to draw lines... how would I be able to do that?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:28): You need to add some global variables and store ev._x and ev._y in them each time you draw, and then use those values in a moveTo the next time you draw (after beginPath and before lineTo)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:29): If you don't use beginPath then you'll never reset to an empty path, so you'll have the problem of repeatedly drawing over the early parts of the path",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:29): (which is an easy mistake because it's hard to notice, but it eventually makes things go really slow and look ugly)",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:29): simply need to anti-alias anything drawn...  what is the best way?",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:31): this is the sample code working, but without anti-aliasing http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/649/example1.html",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:33): It is antialiasing, but it's got this overdraw problem because it never resets the path",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:33): so if you move mouse a hundred times then the first part of the line will have been stroked a hundred times",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:33): and the antialiased grey gets drawn a hundred times and turns black",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:34): which is why it looks aliased",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:37): kinda confused...",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:39): If you say: ctx.strokeStyle = 'red'; ctx.moveTo(0, 0); ctx.lineTo(100, 0); ctx.stroke(); ctx.strokeStyle = 'green'; ctx.lineTo(100, 100); ctx.stroke();",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:39): then it will stroke the first line segment in red, and then it will stroke *both* line segments in green",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:40): because they're both still part of the current path",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:40): and that's what that example is doing (except it's a lot more than two line segments, and it's stroking them all in black)",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:43): i need lines to look like this: http://caimansys.com/painter/index.html",
        "8f86c83f5ef08675a18fb5952b608d6b (20:43): not generic looking...",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:44): goes away for a while"
