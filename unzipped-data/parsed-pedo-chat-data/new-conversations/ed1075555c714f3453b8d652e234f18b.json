However, since all URIs must be resolved relative to [base] before being used to create triples, the use of relative paths should not have any effect on processing.&quot;",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:21): I guess most people would leave it until the last minute before renewing their registration, and it's hard to tell the difference between that and an abandoned domain",

        "c8418bd17d6b1d70bf83c9f1c1664266 (19:22): last minute - yeah, also i'm told some registrars (eg. in Germany) don't let you register lots of years",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:22): You could solve that problem by putting the RDF schema in a data: URL and use that as the namespace, instead of http://",
