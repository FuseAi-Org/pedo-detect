        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (22:47): yaaar, then the problem may lie elsewhere...",

        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (22:48): Jerr: uh, the original is some generic 350w and the new one is an antec...other than that they are pretty much the same",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (22:49): brick: well, the MB state was the same after shutdown, since it never turned on with the new supply",
        "0c30958fe3960c6ed27d8ca6dbe4aab8 (22:49): ok, and if you put the original back in it boots?",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (22:49): right",
        "0c30958fe3960c6ed27d8ca6dbe4aab8 (22:49): ok",
        "a1382140e5ce031f6f10a2e7ea5d9d60 (22:49): Jerr: i was only trying the new supply because i'm trying to track down a machine_check_exception and the PS and CPU are the last things i haven't swapped",
        "0c30958fe3960c6ed27d8ca6dbe4aab8 (22:50): try taking the antec and the mobo out of the case and put it on a phone book",
        "0c30958fe3960c6ed27d8ca6dbe4aab8 (22:50): youve swapped cases?",
