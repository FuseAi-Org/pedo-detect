        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:19): pick me!",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:20): LOL somehow i dont think you are the intended target for my 'Learn how to code' doc",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:20): crap",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:20): ask lucidmonkey ;)",

        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:20): actually if you have a couple of minutes, all i want to know is if the operator precedence section makes sence",

        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:22): What's with the: &gt;&gt;&gt;",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:22): ?",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:22): that is how the python interpreter displays it",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:23): I'd use code snippet blocks to dispaly code snippets, not console output",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:23): btw note the font size ;)",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:23): Oh yeah.... nice",

        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:24): yeh the code blocks need to be changed, i just couldnt be bothered setting up a new extension for it so i used them for now, but i agree and it will be changed",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:25): higher precedence then addition = higher precedence than addition",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:26): eh?",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:26): I think you can remove some &quot;sub-expressions&quot; from the text.... people know what you mean by the time they get past the precedence list",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:26): &quot;then&quot; is wrong in that sentence, it should be &quot;than&quot;",

        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:30): hrm a bit technical to be feeding someone learnign to code dont you think?",
        "299c65574cc8e0763c1b2b1798145581 (19:30): i learn this how it works for a ccd chip",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:30): Well... I'm coding and I still don't know",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:30): ok well i can definitely add that part",
        "299c65574cc8e0763c1b2b1798145581 (19:30): looks like you can say parts of it for every hardware",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:31): as a bit more interesting theory",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:31): People told me several times &quot;it's like a bunch of on and off switches&quot; but that doesn't help... so you got a bunch of switches... lovely... then what?",

        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:32): yeh i can write about that",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:32): Not at a level at which I can build one, just enough so that I think I understand ;)",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (19:33): BTW: I always thought is was: Modulo, not Modulus?",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:33): they are  different tenses of the same thing",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (19:34): actualy thats not the right way to put it...",
