        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:28): it seems like my GL.so* stuff is fine, but no sign of GLX in there",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:29): how do I get pkg to give me a full file listing, I want to check what it thinks nvidia has installed",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:30): vick, well, for starters solaris has a much longer history then linux",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:30): Triskelios : not the one for suse :(",
        "41720969be7b3530ec98c8ea0662a32a (16:30): Gr|ffous, I mean why would i want to do so, what's an advanage in solaris over linux",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:30): and once you realise that linux is basically a copy of solaris, albeit from scratch, it explains a lot really. I've been a linux guy for 5 years now, but I really like the deep history of solaris",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:31): linux is basically a copy of minix",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:31): which, in turn, may be a copy of sol and/or bsd",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:31): whatever floats around",
        "631e53f91030c509ce45bb16bd235cdd (16:31): that's inaccurate.",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:31): I guess it has to be assumed that it will be more stable and realiable, simply based on its maturity vs linux",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:31): everyone steals from everyone",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:31): see <a href=\"http://www.levenez.com/unix/\">http://www.levenez.com/unix/</a>",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:32): honestly, I've only been using solaris for about 2 months now, so I'm really not the best person to ask :)",
        "4f77072af13b0113165e4da71b7a9fdf (16:32): vick: i think the reason quite a few of us choose is standardisation. 'Linux' is just a kernel, really, but there are hundreds of distributions based around that kernel that all want to do things 'their way'. it's a real pain in the ass when you're administering systems or come in and have to administer someone elses servers",
        "4f77072af13b0113165e4da71b7a9fdf (16:33): at least, that's my reason.",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:33): Triskelios: Mesa has an X11 module?",
        "4f77072af13b0113165e4da71b7a9fdf (16:33): my path has been debian -&gt; freebsd -&gt; solaris",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:33): ewdafa : I've also tried all shorts of shit :) [take it with a laugh]",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:33): eventually I went beyond MS and UNIX flavors",
        "2b9d13217ca1d39934ebc86a4be0924f (16:33): jengelh: yes",
        "41720969be7b3530ec98c8ea0662a32a (16:34): ewdafa, So you mean linux is not that nice due to the all that distros around",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:34): vick: just wait until more solarises come up",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:35): _open_solaris is young",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:35): Triskelios : ok you are right",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:35): then I just wonder WTH nvidia installed me",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:36): vick, from a very high level, solaris has a number of advantages in that it's driven by a central team. I guess to use MS in the same sentence, so lets take MAC as an example. Because there is one big team working on the code, if they decide doing something one way is dumb, and there are better ways, they can just change it in a new release. Linux tends to really get bogged down there. Sys V scripts are still everywhere.",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:36): Sun realised they suck, and made smf. That just doesn't happen with linux",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:36): /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/updates/extensions/libglx.so.1.0.8762 quite different from the regular path",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:36): SMF?",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:37): Yeah, Service Management Framework",
        "2b9d13217ca1d39934ebc86a4be0924f (16:37): I think both of you have a very shallow understanding of the issues at hand =P",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:37): Gr|ffous : you mean that svc... thing",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:37): yeah",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:37): Gr|ffous : Why do you think it's bad?",
        "41720969be7b3530ec98c8ea0662a32a (16:38): Gr|ffous, Would does NASA uses solaris and not linux for example ?",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:39): vick: Sometimes that is a GOOD questions. By looking at the price/power ratio, I really question some people's decision-ability.",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:39): a proven track record over the past 20 years, vs an OS that is effectively still under very heavy development.... At least that's a good reason for me",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:39): not limited to solaris...",
        "2b9d13217ca1d39934ebc86a4be0924f (16:39): vick: NASA has a very diverse set of needs, they use whatever OSes are convenient",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:39): jengelh, SYS V scripts?",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:39): Gr|ffous : Yeah I'm missing those in SVC",
        "2b9d13217ca1d39934ebc86a4be0924f (16:39): Gr|ffous, it's Sys V or System V",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:40): some are in /lib/svc/.. but that's not all of them",
        "2b9d13217ca1d39934ebc86a4be0924f (16:40): SYS is not an acronym",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:40): some are in /etc/init.d and some initscripts are nowhere",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:40): so it seems",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:40): it's much more powerful and flexable. Dependancies really really feel like an after thought with the tradional Sys V scripts",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:41): so you favor SVC suddenly?",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (16:41): stupid bloody marketing",
        "2b9d13217ca1d39934ebc86a4be0924f (16:41): jengelh: see /var/svc",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:41): and I love the fact that it will also monitor and restart services for you, automatically. Sure, there are extra tools in linux to do that, like monit",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (16:41): we now have &quot;Availibility Suite&quot;, and &quot;Java Availibility Suite&quot;",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:41): I've always been in favour of it",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (16:41): neither of which have anything to do with Java",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (16:41): and neither of which have anything to do with each other",
        "e166e2eaa2a260067d530b91de396ddb (16:42): Gr|ffous : About the dependencies: svcadm disable system/cryptosvc  implicitly disables ssh. That's fine with me, but it should print a warning NOW and not when running `svcs -x`",
        "d2235432e3c60b3fa00d7deb6a58bcbf (16:43): yeah, that's not cool. It still has some work to be done, but it's a huge leap in the right direction",
        "de3c0885fe754c3202366248a44dc727 (16:45): somebody an easy way to distinguish an x86 of an x64, the output of uname seems to be the same?",
