        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (02:26): you could either not fight and keep supporting, or create a valid concise arguement as to why IE6 is seriously irrelevant anymore",
        "aa0abd9d7e35cef4b0e2802cc422bd4d (02:26): what if they say, we don't agree",

        "aa0abd9d7e35cef4b0e2802cc422bd4d (02:28): it becomes an argument with fools",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (02:28): because it has a long history of still being around",
