        "1eb132838689fd91c07421b73e64a3db (02:17): kinda of topic but does anyone know if bittorrent 4.20.x series is using sparse files? I mean the sparse sets cause it seems to be windows nt by the look of BitTorrent/platform.py get_sparse_files_support",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (02:21): you could ask in #bittorrent",
        "1eb132838689fd91c07421b73e64a3db (02:24): I did :) there is no consense there heh",
        "1eb132838689fd91c07421b73e64a3db (02:24): junt wondering if maybe somebody knew",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (02:24): *cough* sparse files... *cough*",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (02:26): i think azureus supported sparse files at some point, but i can't even  find java docs whether it's implemented or not",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (02:27): at some point the wiki said so, but i've never seen it working",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (02:28): it's not that important but i would be nice",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (02:30): i'm using allocate and zero anyway... minimizes fragmentation :D",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (02:30): working sparse file support would do that too",
        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (02:31): allocate and zero takes time, i hate that ;)",
        "a74c07e77864c0915aebb3126b39f2c9 (02:31): i dont think az ever suported sparse files",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (02:31): doesn't have to... only if the FS tries to keep those blocks free for the preallocated space",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (02:32): hrrm... sure? maybe it was some other app that created several GB of files with a &quot;size on disk = 0&quot; status...",

        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (02:35): get a bigger hdd ;)",
        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (02:35): it'll use up 100% at some point anyway...",

        "d8dc045b509f035f161dc090fd166e9e (02:37): Submit Date \t03-APR-2003 *sigh*",
        "08f7ff37edfbfef18d98da86a67d1ed0 (02:37): bittornado at least has sparse file support",

        "1eb132838689fd91c07421b73e64a3db (02:38): Trewas: yeah, even though if it's a command line option. I wouldn't mind",
        "1eb132838689fd91c07421b73e64a3db (02:38): I have so many patches for the bittorrent 4.20 series that it is annoying",

        "8fa2d0067f92fbec7c550e8068f91809 (02:38): i guess it would require some JNI to do it with java :/",
        "1eb132838689fd91c07421b73e64a3db (02:39): The_8472: yup, just use statfs to check if it is a supported file system, or try to create a sparse file and check if it is sparse",
        "1eb132838689fd91c07421b73e64a3db (02:39): just check if stat(file) st_size != stat(file) st_blocks * 512 ... then it is sparse",
        "1eb132838689fd91c07421b73e64a3db (02:39): or something like that heh",
