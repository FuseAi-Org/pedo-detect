        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:35): well now that raises an interesting point",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:35): what if someone patented versioning?",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (07:37): i'm astounded nobody patented the number &quot;3&quot; yet (yes, the very number)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:38): the number isn't a process",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (07:45): perhaps the process by which you get to the number, via peano arithmetic",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (07:49): 4-1",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (07:51): wonders what peano arithmetic might be",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (07:51): but, AFAIK, you can't patent mathematical equations",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (07:52): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:07): Can someone tell Mike Schinkel how Thunderbird works?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:08): If I remember correctly it certainly supports text plain editing of e-mails.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:08): FYI: http://www.w3.org/mid/op.tqwwnwan64w2qv@id-c0020 (presentation on HTML5 I gave today at QUT)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:14): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 - was the presentation well-received? how many people there?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:14): about 50 or so, I believe they liked it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:15): did you get some good questions?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:15): some people wondered if providing specific elements was going to scale",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:15): like with &lt;progress&gt; and &lt;meter&gt;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:16): so what was your response to that?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:16): my response was that those are pretty fundamental features for most operating systems and applications",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:17): and that we're only adding features with very good use cases",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:18): and also that if they had a better way of doing it they should certainly join!",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:18): heh",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:19): anyway, perhaps a good reason why it might help to have the use cases behind those elements (and other parts of the spec) better documented",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:19): also how it relates to Web 2.0 and Ajax",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:20): to which I replies that we're basically trying to improve upon that movement",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:20): &quot;evolving the web&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:30): I'm thinking that for presentations like this, it'd also be useful to have a record of the Q&amp;A. Could use RRSagent for that, use scribe formatter thingy to generate HTML-formatted record of it as we do for WG meetings.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:31): then post URI to www-archive",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:32): yeah, maybe",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:32): yawns",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:32): no RRSAgent where I gave it though",

        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (08:39): i wish i understood better this &quot;pixel perfect&quot; thread/bussiness. is that what would be needed to be able to print html decentrly? /to be more specific, what would be needed to finally get rid of pdf once and for all)",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (08:39): and if this is so...what's needed in thml itself? isn't it a css matter?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:42): It's not for &lt;canvas&gt;",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:42): It's for the other stuff, although HTML elements might have some default CSS applied to it",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:43): Have some default CSS applied to it for certain media",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:43): default rendering should be specified to some extent for interop",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:44): it's hard to walk the line between over- and under-specifying there",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:44): Great extent probably",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (08:44): It's amazing what people rely on",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:44): well, like I said, I don't think you want to standardize things like how to rasterize glyphs, what fonts must be available, whether to use bilinear or bicubic scaling for scaled images, etc",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:45): I also don't want to rule out the various hacks that mobile browsers do to fit text content to a small screen",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (08:50): what would take to completely get rid of pdf? to end up with just one content authoring language, html?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:52): I think dhyatt's description of &lt;canvas&gt; as &quot;just a dynamic image&quot; is apt.",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:05): yes",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:05): the reason it's not there is for backcompat",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:07): it is there",
