I'm doing a GUI for a game bot (gui's aren't my thing) and I need to draw tiles of jpegs (overhead map) and then draw some kind of blips over the jpeg's to signify specific objects (like a small icon for players, mobs, game objects, etc). nothing too fancy, just to get an idea of what is around you. any suggestions on where to start with somethin' like that?",
