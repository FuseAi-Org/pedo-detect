        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (09:05): Sharcho: not directly.  you can do 7d5d to delete 35 lines, for instance",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (09:05): you might look into map-operator in vim7",

        "624e7733d6f22d10bf4418778e64d37d (09:15): is there an p(ut) like command that not inserts text but replaces?",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (09:17): visually select the text and then paste, although I suggest storing the text that you want to paste in a named register so it isn't overwritten when you paste",
        "624e7733d6f22d10bf4418778e64d37d (09:19): jamessan: thats not working.. whats working is to visualy select the needed area before inserting.. and thats annoying and also the register is lost..",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (09:20): it works just fine. yank the text you want to paste into register a (for example). visually select the text you want to replace. paste from register a",
        "624e7733d6f22d10bf4418778e64d37d (09:22): oh, you missunderstood me.. wait i try to tell it more exactly",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (09:22): I think he wants to do a combo ddp, but not have the old register clobbered first",
        "624e7733d6f22d10bf4418778e64d37d (09:22): not my own language..",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (09:22): like a paste with a {motion}",
        "624e7733d6f22d10bf4418778e64d37d (09:23): i want it to work just like p(P) but not to replace instead of insert",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (09:23): there is no built in command for that as far as I know",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (09:23): you're not clarifying what you want to replace. the current line?",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (09:24): mael: you have to select the text you want it to replace. then just use p or P like normal",

        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (09:28): I didn't really think about it being a character for character replacement",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (09:28): it'll only work if the length of the text you're replacing is less than/equal to that of the text you're pasting",
