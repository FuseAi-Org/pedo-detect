        "0e29e35b432c7d4b3ae3274a3fc600aa (18:17): you can't go back after you switch to dynamic disk",
        "1d1867ba7d03bd5e4f6ff74f1403b497 (18:18): No, there is a warning about lost all data",

        "33c77cc905fbf62054004331d24de8a2 (18:46): google 101 comes before signing an exe 101 :)",

        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:48): I'm going to sign putty with my CA cert, so I can setup a <a href=\"http://putty.somewhere.org\">http://putty.somewhere.org</a> that always returns a &quot;safe&quot; putty. &quot;safe&quot; in the sense that it will not generate a warning of the same kind as an unsigned exe",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:49): how would I install windows XP on a computer that currently has Ubuntu linux on it? That computer does not have the ability to boot from CD (yes I have checked bios, yes I am sure it can't boot from CD) and I have no way of getting a floppy disk",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:49): I do however have a computer that does boot from CD",
        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:50): Techno: I'm sorry to say it, but that problem is SO much easier to solve if you were trying to install ubuntu over windows",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:50): i know",
        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:50): Techno: just out of curiosity, btw, why are you uninstalling ubuntu?",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:50): I used instlux to start the install",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:51): I am uninstalling ubuntu because I only want this computer to host files for the rest of my LAN and the proccess that should have been easy in Ubuntu to have that happen has turned out to be less than easy",
        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:51): Techno: the easiest solution is take the disk out, put it in another machine, install there, put back, get a warning about de-activation because of changed hardware, call MS, press numbers in slowly over the phone, get new activation code, enter them, hope it works, then use it",
        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:51): Techno: that's the price to pay.. :-/",

        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:53): Techno: it's a hakc",

        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:53): Techno: But it might work. I still wouldn't do it, though",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (18:53): the problem resides in the fact that Windows wants to write the MBR with only its stuff, where as  Linux distros install GRUB (or LILO) which support multiple boots)",
        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:53): yes, for one thing",

        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:54): I hate GRUB with a passion... it seems to work... but if you try setting up a dual boot environment and then later find that you want to go back to using just one OS I find that you have problems",
        "33c77cc905fbf62054004331d24de8a2 (18:54): I use grub to just boot xp",
        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:54): Techno: why would you say that? it's really not true",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (18:54): if Windows is already on the system, Ubuntu or whatever, will recognize WIndows and incorporate it in its GRUB.",
        "33c77cc905fbf62054004331d24de8a2 (18:54): no problem with it",
        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:54): Techno: I've used grub to boot only windows, that works fine",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:54): It was true in my case, which is why I said that I found that you would have problems",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (18:54): Techno:  thats just not true at all",
        "b4ef09e217433c222585fa6a97762892 (18:54): Techno: and I've overwritten it with windows' boot manager. works fine as well",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (18:54): I have too many times",
        "33c77cc905fbf62054004331d24de8a2 (18:54): I have to boot via grub, no choice :P",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:55): It's true that I found it to have problems. They key word there is 'I'",
        "e779defee7904698907f14d5ba9b70a2 (18:55): I'll just take my leave now, since it seems these guys know what they're talking about",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (18:55): then you just dont know how to configure it then :)   Its very good at what it does :)",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:56): I had to strip my hard drive from my computer, put it in another computer, use a rescue CD to fix the mbr then put my hard drive back into my computer because Grub freaked out when I got rid of Ubuntu on the dual boot setup",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (18:56): you could have just done fixmbr :)",
        "33c77cc905fbf62054004331d24de8a2 (18:56): grub has a booting commandline, quite convenient",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (18:56): done that many times :)",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:57): kkathman that's what I did because my computer can't boot from CD",
        "33c77cc905fbf62054004331d24de8a2 (18:57): if it doesnt boot from cd, can it even run xp?",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:57): yes",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:58): I don't know why people are so amazed about the not being able to boot from CD. It's just bad hardware.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (18:58): its amazing, because good common sense, would tell you that you need to have such things for security and backup things :)",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (18:59): I picked up the computer in question for five bucks at a thrift store",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (19:00): it runs windows xp fine, if slowly. It runs ubuntu nicely... the only glaring problem is that it won't boot from CD even when using new CD drives and the bios saying that CD drives will boot before hard drives",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (19:00): CD-Rom drives are around $12-15 at similar stores :)    FDD's are $5",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (19:00): a very small price to pay for peace of mind and convenience",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (19:00): it's only really a problem when I want to install a new OS, which I rarely want to do",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (19:01): aside from that, it's not a computer I will use daily once I have it set up properly... in a perfect world once I get it set up it'd be nice never to have to touch it again",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (19:01): I now have a very nice laptop and I have another working computer"
