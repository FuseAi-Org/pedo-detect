        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:51): I found it through: http://www.whathuhstudios.com/press/2008/04/24/html5/",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:51): terrible",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:51): I have the feeling you're being sarcastig :)",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (10:52): there's no mention of the MIT license anywhere and no attribution",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:53): attribution is not required",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (10:54): actually, yes it is.  At least in Australia it is because attribution is considered a basic moral right",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:54): our goal with the whatwg blog is to get more people to know about stuff right?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (10:55): unless otherwise stated by the creator, attribution is always required otherwise it's plagiarism",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:55): Yeah, guess I was just upset it wasn't a genuine fansite :)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:55): oh there's no doubt that this is immoral",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:55): but i recommend not worrying about it",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (10:56): I don't have a problem with them syndicating the posts. That's why we put a free license on it.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:56): yeah but just copying them with no attribution or anything is just nasty",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (10:57): I will see if I can find contact information and ask them to give attribution",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:01): ask them to buy us video games with some of the money they make, too",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:03): WHOIS info for the domain only shows dreamhost contact info.",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:07): it seems to me that the foremost practical concern is getting Google and Technorati consider it a splog",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:07): perhaps they both already do, because it isn't showing up on my vanity feeds",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:08): so it will take a few weeks before it shows up in google",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:09): delta specs suck",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:10): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: well I don't know what to expect from XML5 so I can't predict if that will be sensible",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:11): would it, for example, accept unquoted attribute values?",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:13): and otherwise the delta would be where errors fire",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:14): of course, ideally ideally, the internal subset would be swallowed by a black hole",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:14): well &lt;foo/&gt; would have to do something different, as well",

        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (11:18): actually, fixing the implementation's comparatively easy, it's all those stupid tests I've written that are taking the lion's share of the time to change",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (11:18): and all the tests others have written that use postMessage since it was introduced",
