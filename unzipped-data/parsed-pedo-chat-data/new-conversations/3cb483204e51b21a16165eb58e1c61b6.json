        "40cddb5ac261f4694179715cd8424278 (01:41): They noted it in the release notes and everything.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:41): do they show the right favicon?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:42): (which is to say, no favicon or a cat, but not a red square)",
        "40cddb5ac261f4694179715cd8424278 (01:42): There's no adress bar, so can't see favicons...",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:42): ah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:47): anyone got any opinions on how WebSRT cues should parse if they don't have a valid timestamp?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:48): Drop on the floor?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:49): the whole cue up to the next double blank line?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:49): that's kinda what i figured should happen",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:49): other options are to just ignore the one line and try reading a timestamp from the next one",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:49): or to drop the whole file from there on",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:50): or to assume a timestamp of 0",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:50): or of equal to the last timestamp seen",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:51): I don't think anything that assumes a timestamp would be good.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:51): Dropping the whole file is no good either, if the rest is properly formatted.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:51): Ignoring just that line and trying the next sounds potentially cool.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:52): So, one of those two.  Either skip the line, or skip everything until the next double blank line.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:53): i guess skip the block is safest",
