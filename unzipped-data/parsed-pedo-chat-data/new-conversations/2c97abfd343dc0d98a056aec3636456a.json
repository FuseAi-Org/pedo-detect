        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (20:55): what would prevent smtp from accepting external connections???",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (20:55): I don't have ipf enabled on that machine as firewalling occures before the connection even arrives there",

        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (20:56): hi2u :)",
        "cf9c2358021b318d3ee55cddb68e5677 (20:56): So if i want to install a set i did not install during the first installation i can just unpack the set-file in / ?",

        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (21:07): would you have any idea why it would respond internally but not externally? I'm pretty sure it isn't the router (ipf/ipnat on another machine) as I can use NC to open connections to that machine on other ports",
        "f17df95f77e0187feb7fa14ec3ef246b (21:07): hola guys",
