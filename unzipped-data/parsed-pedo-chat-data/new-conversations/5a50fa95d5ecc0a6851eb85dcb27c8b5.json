        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:04): well html5 is already well over a THOUSAND diffs!",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:04): so it must be AWESOME!",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:04): not good enough.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:04): we haven't reached 1337 yet.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:04): I think you have to count the amount of diffs since it reached Recommendation status",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:04): (nor 313373)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:05): The more the merrier at that point, it seems",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:05): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: ah well, that's not happening before 2022. so oh well.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:05): likes 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e's certainty of his timetable",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:05): I expect we may well write the test cases quicker than you expect",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:06): hey we've hit every milestone that's gone so far",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:06): on the timetable i put forward last year",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (00:06): I dunno",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (00:06): You can never have enough testcases",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:06): (though by &quot;we&quot; i mean &quot;the whatwg&quot;, not the htmlwg, sadly)",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:06): It's much easier to write test cases for fun bits of the spec than for the rest of it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:06): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: well ok, the one! :_P",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:07): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: I wrote several thousand during my spec review for a couple of algorithms",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:07): 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: hey! I'm a loser with no life! What do you want me to do!?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (00:07): I wonder how long until I regret checking the testcase box in the survey",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:07): get one?",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (00:07): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: I assume those are chardet tests? or sniffing tests? have you published them?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:07): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: yeah, that was the answer I was waiting for",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:08): is only interested in the features that have pretty colours",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:08): 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e: no, some of the common microsyntaxes",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:08): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, I'm glad I live up to your expectations",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:09): maybe we should prioritize the rendering section then, 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:09): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Were the several thousand each written by hand?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:09): 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: yes, but they are very systematic and can be written very quickly",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:09): (i.e., there is one bit of test data with an output for each of a set of the algorithms)",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:12): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Okay - that's much less like cheating than my 7809 tokeniser tests :-)",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:13): (Hmm, tokenisers don't have pretty colours, which destroys my theory)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (00:13): Maybe we need someone to rate the different parts of the spec and assign testcase points of different amounts",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:13): (you did generate graphs out of the tokenizer spec)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:14): one problem with any kind of testsuite organization at this point is that the specification isn't stable",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:16): 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e: &lt;http://hg a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554.com/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/php-html-5-direct/file/d050bcea1a03/tests/numbersTest&gt; now I've reuploaded them",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:17): anyhow, time for me to go to sleep so I can get up in time for school tomorrow (where I can try and get a life)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:17): 6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e: see README is the same dir",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (00:17): 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: &quot;I wrote a million testcases, and all I got was this lousy candidate recommendation&quot;",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (00:18): ah, thanks a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:32): Argh, there's too many bugs",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (00:35): Do you get that warm, happy feeling inside when you discover one and can make a testcase to display it?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:39): the problem is when you find more bugs while making the testcase",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:39): then the warm happy feeling starts feeling more like standing on quicksand",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:53): I'm mostly just looking at my old canvas tests, so I'm not even discovering anything new :-(",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:54): (Found one Opera bug which I don't think I knew about before, though)",
