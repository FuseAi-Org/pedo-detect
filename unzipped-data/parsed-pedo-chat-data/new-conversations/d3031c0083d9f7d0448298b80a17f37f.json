        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (18:58): Okay, so this is an interesting proposal from Sylvain.  Plan for the &quot;From-Origin&quot; header to let sites opt into same-origin restrictions for any resource.  Then, have @font-face act as if &quot;From-Origin:same&quot; was sent by default (overrideable by actually sending From-Origin).",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:06): It partially does.  The default behavior of fonts is different, but they're all controllable with the same mechanism in this proposal, unlike the existing idea of using SOR+CORS for font, and From-Origin for other things.",
