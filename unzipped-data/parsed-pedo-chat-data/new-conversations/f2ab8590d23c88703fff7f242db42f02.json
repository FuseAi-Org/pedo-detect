        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (15:36): http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/a-joke-in-the-python-interpreter",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (15:53): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, is it easy to modify your survey tool to check how often the adoption agency algorithm is triggered? Especially the clone node operation in it...",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (15:59): If there's somewhere in the html5lib code where it could poke some value that I could read out again after parsing, then I guess that'd be easy enough",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:02): (But &quot;survey tool&quot; makes it sound more impressive and useful than just being the non-representative collection of a couple of thousand pages with a parser being called on them in a loop which is all it really is :-) )",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:08): hehe",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:08): I think you'd have to make such a value yourself",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:14): 6. Let a bookmark note the position of the formatting element in the list of active formatting elements...",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:14): hmm, I guess that line should be rephrased a little",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:14): (step 6 of the adoption agency)",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:16): oh nvm, i understand it now, note is used as a verb here",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:27): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: I ought to have time this afternoon to try looking at that",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:29): cool",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:29): 425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72, btw, I'd aim for making a full parser at first and create filtering tools for it later",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:30): 425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72, that makes it more usable for other people who want to use it where support for &lt;blah&gt; and &lt;link&gt; is important",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:30): yeah, that's sort of what i'm doing now",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:30): cool :)",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:30): but first i need the adoption agency working properly",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:33): It seems worrying that the adoption agency sometimes cuts its children into multiple pieces",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:34): it clones them",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:34): and distributes them among parents afterwards",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:35): But the content of the original tags gets split apart and spread between all the clones",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:36): I'm sure that kind of thing can't be legal",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:37): :p",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:45): I need to do something about the tree construction\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 but probably better to get the other stuff working fix :P",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:45): *first",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:49): where in the algorithm do P elements close elements such as A and B?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:49): why would &lt;p&gt; close them?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:50): &lt;a&gt;&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is legal",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:50): or really, sweet",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:50): well, &quot;legal&quot;",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:50): &lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt; should work too",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:50): yeah, i know what you mean :p",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:51): &lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; makes things interesting...",
        "425fb52813381a0bc3fce51541c8ca72 (16:53): hmm, but when I look at the testcase with the code &quot;&lt;a&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;a&gt;Y&lt;/a&gt;Z&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in http://html5lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/tree-construction/tests1.dat , the parser closes the first A element when it sees the P element",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:53): you make incorrect assumptions",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:54): the magic happens the moment you hit the second &lt;a&gt;",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:54): not when you hit &lt;p&gt;",
