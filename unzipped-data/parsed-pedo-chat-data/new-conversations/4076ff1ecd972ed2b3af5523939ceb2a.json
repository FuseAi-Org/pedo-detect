        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:08): all existing stuff is fixored",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:08): now all the new stuff needs doing",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:10): if a page has a .manifest file, should the UA check for a new version of each content file on load? If not, when should it?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:11): only when the manifest changes",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:12): so how would I designate that a file had been updated?",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:12): (i.e. a .js file with a new version)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:12): you change the manifest",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:12): e.g. change a comment or do something like foo.js?v=2",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:12): or add whitespace?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:13): could work",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:13): seems flawed",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:13): we can make it more complicated later",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:13): suggestion: allow a .manifest to include last-modified datetimes for each file",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:13): that would be complicated",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:13): so the UA can figure out if it should grab a new rev",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:14): until then, I can't use manifests for my webapps/widgets/etc",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:14): why?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:14): you can just print the timestamp as comment, no?",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:15): yeah, but then it'd grab a new version of every file for every load",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:15): the server can return 304 like it can normally",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:15): defeats the purpose",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:15): if your file changes all the time you should prolly not put it in the manifest",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:16): no, I'm debugging",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:16): and I'll end up updating it to make new versions",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:19): you know, mantinence, new features...",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:19): bugfixes",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:20): sure",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:20): so add manifest when most of the other stuff is done",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:20): I don't really see the problem here",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:21): here's my idea:",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:22): the manifest file could be generated by a script, or just manually edited, so it include last-modified dates for each file in it",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:22): so when offline, the UA uses its cached versions of everything",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:22): and when online, it just checks the manifest against its stored manifest",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:22): to see if there's a new version of anything",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:22): yeah, I just told you you can do that",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:22): if there is, it just downloads THAT file",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:23): otherwise, it keeps using its cached version",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:23): it doesn't download the whole file anyway",
        "c9c91d70d978f16fd2146644f2030d54 (22:23): the whole cached entity, or the whole .manifest?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:23): the former",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:24): it just does a request and the server can say 304",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:24): For all those people nagging me about Anolis while I've been away, the following statement is true: 10:40 #whatwg: &lt; jgraham&gt; edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 has explicitly lost interest in anolis",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:24): SPDY will prolly optimize away the remaining bits",
