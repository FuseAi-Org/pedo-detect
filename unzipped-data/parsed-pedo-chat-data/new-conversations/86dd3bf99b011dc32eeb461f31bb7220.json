        "589d9e3fcd236eaf94f06440ad85e233 (09:56): yeah that's wrong",
        "032ee69e7e33409140cf0a80ee96246a (09:57): is there a section on marhsalling and making calls to unmanaged code?",

        "032ee69e7e33409140cf0a80ee96246a (09:58): it needs a section talking about the IDE",
        "032ee69e7e33409140cf0a80ee96246a (09:58): and a link to the express cause it is free",
        "589d9e3fcd236eaf94f06440ad85e233 (09:58): yeah and probably SharpDevelop too",
        "032ee69e7e33409140cf0a80ee96246a (09:58): yes",
        "032ee69e7e33409140cf0a80ee96246a (10:07): are you working on parts of it?",

        "589d9e3fcd236eaf94f06440ad85e233 (10:33): usually just the little javascript window that they provide",
        "589d9e3fcd236eaf94f06440ad85e233 (10:34): they have buttons for the basic elements at the top, but i belive some things are missing (such as tables)",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (10:35): if wikis used a standardized document format for example XPS.... :P",

        "4eebb990e98982ce6579a9c1b716e44d (10:41): A wiki (originally called Quickweb) is an editable website that does not require users to know HTML. &lt;-- That is correct however it causes them to have to learn another language that is just as hard as html if not harder",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (10:42): where is the source for that &quot;originally called quickweb&quot; part?",

        "4eebb990e98982ce6579a9c1b716e44d (10:43): of course not",
        "4eebb990e98982ce6579a9c1b716e44d (10:43): no source is",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (10:43): The first wiki, WikiWikiWeb, is named after the &quot;Wiki Wiki&quot; line of Chance RT-52 buses in Honolulu International Airport, Hawaii. It was created in 1994 and installed on the web in 1995 by Ward Cunningham, who also created the Portland Pattern Repository. &quot;Wiki-wiki&quot; means &quot;hurry quick&quot; in Hawaiian. It also refers to a type of native fish of the islands.",

        "4eebb990e98982ce6579a9c1b716e44d (10:45): I doubt that too, how does one know the exact origin of something especially during a highly chaotic unorganized time for the internet",
        "4eebb990e98982ce6579a9c1b716e44d (10:45): that might have been the first usages of the term wiki",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (10:45): sabiancrash - probably because the guy was smart and documented everything he was doing? :)",
        "4eebb990e98982ce6579a9c1b716e44d (10:46): but what it the first use of alternate markup for the purposes of information sharing?",
        "4eebb990e98982ce6579a9c1b716e44d (10:47): I would like to meet that man, cause documentation is a lost art",
        "4eebb990e98982ce6579a9c1b716e44d (10:47): no one documents anymore",
        "7e8feb04599ce5d0b4e20df3ee88e361 (10:47): so true",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (10:49): also",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (10:49): pretty much every wiki has its own markup",
