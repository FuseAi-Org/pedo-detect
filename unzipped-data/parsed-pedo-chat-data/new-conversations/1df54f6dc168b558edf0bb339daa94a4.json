        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:18): XHTML2 only started in 2002?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:18): wow",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:18): lachy: you have a sentence that goes &quot;However, ..., but ...&quot; which is awkward",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:19): yeah, I should fix that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:19): dunno, you have internal access now :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:21): &quot;there are over 300 participants already&quot; is ambiguous about which group you mean",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:21): i'd write &quot;there are over 300 participants in the W3C group already&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:21): or some such",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:21): though if you say that you might want to also point out that there are over 700 in the whatwg :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:25): &quot;These days, the W3C process is quite strict.&quot; the process is... doesn't mean much has changed though",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:26): other than that looks good",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:32): Fixed the participant issue and the &quot;however/but&quot; issue",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:33): should I change anything about the W3C process?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:36): look in w3c-html-wg around that time maybe",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:41): that's where I'm looking",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:41): I found a few brief mentions of XHTML2 in a few threads, but nothing linking to an editors draft or anything",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:42): I might just say it began around 2001-2002",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:46): updates the whatwg.org front page",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:46): it's been dragged kicking and screaming into 2007",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:46): I changed it to &quot;XHTML2 has been in &lt;em&gt;secret&lt;/em&gt; development since around 2001\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2002 and...&quot;",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:49): the new layout doesn't look right in Safari 2.0.4",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:49): that's ironic, given that i used safari trunk to do it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:49): can't win, i guess :-P",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:49): maybe you should add opt-in versioning in your browser, i hear that solves this kind of problem",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:50): fixes",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:50): snickers",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:53): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 - as far as the &quot;They include representatives from 4 major browser vendors: Mozilla, Opera, Safari and IE&quot; part, Nokia also makes a browser and is a member of the HTML WG.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:53): i wouldn't call nokia a &quot;major browser vendor&quot;",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:53): so does AOL, if you want to get technical",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:53): and the w3c...",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:54): they're the 4 that most people will care about.  There's no need to list every single particpant",
        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (05:54): I wonder if Nokia or Apple have shipped more browsers...",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:54): Nokia has probably shipped more total browser units, but likely fewer of browsers actually written by them rather than licensed",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:55): but all the browsers they shipped probably add up to less use share than Safari",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:55): if web stats can be at all trusted",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (05:55): later folks",

        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (05:55): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, later mate",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:55): install base isn't a particularily interesting metric",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:55): by install base, lynx has huge numbers.",
        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (05:56): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, not that huge - but probably similar to Safari",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:56): every linux server out there has lynx on it",
        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (05:57): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, it's not installed by default on Debian &amp; Ubuntu...",

        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (05:57): I'm not even sure about telnet",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:58): in any case",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:58): usage is what matters, not install base",
        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (06:00): I think install base can be an interesting number. Perhaps Nokia would have interesting ideas about why people aren't using the browsers they're shipping. Certainly ui, network speed and cost are factors but perhaps there are issues at the protocol and formats level that affect it.",
        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (06:00): And that's only kind of a devil's advocate position",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:00): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, indeed.  If installed base mattered, then IE would have 100% of all Windows machines, but we know that there are many windows users that use other browsers",
        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (06:01): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, but Nokia has customers who chose to buy a product with web browsing as a feature, but for some reason they're not using it.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:01): + a small percentage of Mac and Linux web that run IE through virtualisation or other means",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:01): support for real Web applications is also what matters. Nokia's Webkit-based browser has CSS, Javascript/XHR support.",
        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (06:02): oh nice!",
        "db7449d0d57e60791235054bcf9c7e5d (06:02): my mobile browser didn't do any of that stuff :(",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:02): and I'm not sure why it's important to make the distinction of &quot;major&quot; browser vendors",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:02): btw if anyone wants to twitter to the whatwg account for some reason (e.g. if you want to hack the blog so it twitters when there's a new post), let me know",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:03): i don't want to put the password out, since then we could lose control of the account if anyone wants to be nasty",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:03): we could set the blog up so that the excerpt gets twittered",
