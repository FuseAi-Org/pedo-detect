They want an effect like the Star Wars intro, where text goes fading into the background. Is it feasible to use blender to create such an effect, perhaps as a video clip?",

        "81bccac225d6fb06c1f1dd3356ad2a88 (22:06): But the answer could potentially be quick!",
        "90ac575b341f31c52868c9bc2aec46a4 (22:06): And yes it probably would be.",
        "81bccac225d6fb06c1f1dd3356ad2a88 (22:07): 1) &quot;No way, blender can't do animations. Sorry.&quot;, 2) &quot;Oh yeah, it's easy to do that sort of thing. Just click on...&quot;",
        "90ac575b341f31c52868c9bc2aec46a4 (22:08): 2), without going into the explanation",
        "81bccac225d6fb06c1f1dd3356ad2a88 (22:08): Okay, cool.",
        "81bccac225d6fb06c1f1dd3356ad2a88 (22:08): I'll go ahead and dive in, then.",
        "90ac575b341f31c52868c9bc2aec46a4 (22:09): but if you haven't used Blender before it may be more difficult then you thought",

        "81bccac225d6fb06c1f1dd3356ad2a88 (22:09): But not a lot.",
        "90ac575b341f31c52868c9bc2aec46a4 (22:09): And if the only reason you want to use it is to make an intro like that I'm not sure if you really want to",

        "81bccac225d6fb06c1f1dd3356ad2a88 (22:09): Is there another tool that would be better suited?",
        "81bccac225d6fb06c1f1dd3356ad2a88 (22:10): It needs to be stuffed into a powerpoint presentation, so I was thinking that if I could generate an AVI, that would work.",

        "90ac575b341f31c52868c9bc2aec46a4 (22:12): Really shouldn't be that hard, hardest part will be aligning all the text and angling it just right",

        "81bccac225d6fb06c1f1dd3356ad2a88 (22:13): I just had a thought: I wonder if there is a way to do this in Flash.",

        "90ac575b341f31c52868c9bc2aec46a4 (22:14): From what I understand flash is as easy to make things for as Adobe Illustrator or gimp",

        "6f677b7cfbfe83f9a9a282734ed34459 (22:26): that's funky",

        "6f677b7cfbfe83f9a9a282734ed34459 (22:29): but it wants me to make them each a different color",

        "4e034d79f6fd38d71ee4b49748485a3e (22:34): urz, yes a mesh can have multimat",
