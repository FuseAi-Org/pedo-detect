        "f4ea20ae05d2da565e774193265e2df2 (00:54): does it _have_ to be sized in a such a way that the client area is a multiple of the font dimensions?",
        "0c40c1bf00d55d35ab17baf2cbec36f8 (00:55): Yes (unless you override the x properties, or tell your wm to ignore them), but that shouldn't cause what you are seeing.",
        "0c40c1bf00d55d35ab17baf2cbec36f8 (00:56): It should just only take up as much room as it can use and leave the rest empty. The fact that it is unmaximizing and then resizing itself to that large is a bug, likely an interaction bug between gvim/gtk+ and kde.",
        "0c40c1bf00d55d35ab17baf2cbec36f8 (00:56): Well, &quot;bug&quot;.",
