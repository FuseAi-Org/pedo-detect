        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:46): I would go skiing, but unfortunately I can't for at least another 4 to 6 weeks. :-(",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:56): but at least it's not too far. Just jump on bus 34 or 54 on monday morning",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (16:22): I understand that moving the division into a non-critical path so it can be done at the computer's leisure is *theoretically* a good thing, but the fact that this actually translates into a 10% speedup is astonishing.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:25): It's more befuddling because CPUs rearrange computations too",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (16:27): I know!  It's crazy.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (16:30): I was doing an array walk, based on the value in the array.  Previously the division was required to find the next index and I simply collected the value, but I swapped it so I use the division to collect values, and use the array val itself as the next index.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (16:30): (In more specific terms, I was factoring a number using a slightly modified Sieve of Eratosthenes.  Originally I stored the smallest factor of the index, now I store the largest factor.)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:34): You mean so it can now do the division and memory fetch in parallel, or something like that?",
