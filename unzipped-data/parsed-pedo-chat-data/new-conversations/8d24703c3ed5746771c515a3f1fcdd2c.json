Chromium bugs get dealt with extremely quickly, Mozilla gets a response but is less likely to be fixed immediately, WebKit is usually ignored, Opera I can't tell, IE I'm not sure in general because I've only filed two bugs.",

(2) sometimes we have the bad habit of just ignoring bug reports we don't understand rather than saying &quot;I don't understand this&quot;",
