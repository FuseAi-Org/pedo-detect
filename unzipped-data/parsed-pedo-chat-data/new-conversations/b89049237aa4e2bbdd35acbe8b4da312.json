        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:31): Some people are claiming that modifying the network buffers(not touching mtu); will increase speeds from a .us 100mbit to a european site. The current speeds are 200kbps; and they say if I increase the network buffers in /etc/sysctl.conf that it will go to 3 megs a second.",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:32): Anyone think this is possible/likely? or are they fos?",

        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:33): depends",

        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:33): most likely is that your isp has bad transit to rest of the workd",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:33): but other from that...",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:33): rising windowsizes and interruptbuffers is usually a good idea no matter of if the connection goes 1 hop or 200 hops",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:34): you can take a look at my settings for 100/100 at <a href=\"http://www.tbg.nu/iptables.txt\">http://www.tbg.nu/iptables.txt</a>",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:34): Apachez: Why do all GNU / Linux operating systems come with lower network buffers..if increasing them makes speeds so much faster?",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:35): dunno",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:35): i am too a bit &quot;angry&quot; that they are still using default settings back from 1985 where the fastest connection was 33.6kbit modems",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:35): I saw once a benchmark test of a p2p connection (1 hop) where they compared default settings with modified settings for gbit network",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:36): without touching mtu",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:36): the speed went from approx 150mbit to 700 mbit just by chainging txqueuelen and windowsizes",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:36): and then another boost when using jumboframes (9000 instead of 1500)",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:36): damn; yea they're claiming speeds like this.",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:37): Especially from one country to another.",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:37): you can also check the land speed record settings",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:37): ie; asia to .us; and .eu to .us",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:37): those are a bit extreme but still",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:37): they use stuff like 100 meg for windowsize :P",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:39): Why does barely no one use these techniques?",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:43): we are :P",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:43): the stupid thing is that the default settings havent changed",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:43): most likely because they are supposed to be conservative",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:43): like if linux supports 386 it should work on a 386 with 1 meg ram aswell",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:44): and on such machine it would be a bit problematic to allow windowsize of 8 meg",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:44): Does it increase latency? Maybe they want to maintain a certain amount of low latency?",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:45): most likely lower latency somewhat because packets wont need to be retransmitted as often",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:47): I would like to see the kernel be optimized for say at least 100mbit from scratch",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:47): and then have a kernel option when you boot which could lower the settings to &quot;old default&quot;",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:47): or perhaps have a couple of preconfigurated modes",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:48): like 10mbit, 100mbit, 1gbit, 10ge",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:48): yea; that'd be nice.",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:48): where default would be 100mbit and with kernel param at boot (or after boot via proc) set it to another default value",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:48): Have the GNU / Linux distribution automatically figure out the pipe / RAM; and adjust properly.",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:48): this way you wouldnt have to spend 40 hours to read all sort of opinions what are &quot;good&quot; values and test them yourself back and forth",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:50): I'm in .us; and my server is in .us; I'm on a 10mbit down; but I only get 500 kbps from this server; You think if I modify network buffers it will increase my speed?",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:50): you could test ?",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:50): My pipe doesn't seem to be saturated. I'll spike at 1.5 megs a second sometimes. 900 kbps steady on a good connection",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:50): you can try my settings and see if they help",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:50): if not just reboot :P",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:50): Are those for a 100mbit?",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:51): it's athlon 2800+ 512 megs of RAM; and 100mbit pipe from layeredtech",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:51): yup 100mbit",
        "cce85e723d6886c97e13c3a7adae9841 (15:51): And I use probably 100 megs of RAM; and the rest is free.",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:51): what i noticed with these settings was that the traffic had a better flow",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:51): previous settings gave me more spikes in the graphs when i did a benchmark",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:52): the new settings will go upp to 100mbit directly and basically stay there",
        "673d7d497cb7c30e46ce951bc321aafd (15:52): the benchmark starts with small chunks and works its way up to 1gbyte transfer"
