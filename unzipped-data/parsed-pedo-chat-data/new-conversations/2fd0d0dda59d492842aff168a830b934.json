        "1adba86c435b5fe0f7ea043370b1636b (23:18): I really don't know how much work it involves, but if it were easy I'd imagine it would have been done by now",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:27): and how does that work with the &quot;?body=...&quot; stuff?",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (23:29): interesting",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:29): though i guess that could also be just a bug in pine",
