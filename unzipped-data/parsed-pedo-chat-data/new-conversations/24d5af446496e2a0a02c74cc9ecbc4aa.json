        "f96fb07ac48db03332cd37a5d31708f0 (11:49): well.. I'm just looking arround.. I'll need some offline storage scheme for my final at my post graduation course",
        "6776a0df301145ee5837cb2c31372d21 (11:51): Well. Works fine. localStorage is easier though if you don't want to store loads.",

        "f96fb07ac48db03332cd37a5d31708f0 (12:10): in this comparison http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28HTML5%29 they say that is just partially supported for some browsers",
