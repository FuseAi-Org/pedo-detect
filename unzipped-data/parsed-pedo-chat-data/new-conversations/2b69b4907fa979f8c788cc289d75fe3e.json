        "d6e61f0fdc57d5496977311585e7a599 (02:09): if it doesn't align right, then you'll either need to adjust the axis it's mirroring on, or you'll need to adjust the objects center to be aligned with the middle of the object",
        "3d0852aac731384c3b789eac0ccae8b6 (02:09): ok",
        "3d0852aac731384c3b789eac0ccae8b6 (02:10): how do i get rid of the middle funny looking line i know is control N to recalculate but prior to that how do i make the two halfs a whole piece",

        "984724c86e0fca843250d6eda9056728 (02:14): then you do not need to make new faces",
        "3d0852aac731384c3b789eac0ccae8b6 (02:14): yeah?",

        "3d0852aac731384c3b789eac0ccae8b6 (02:15): ok so first in object mode i can dup and them mirror",
        "d6e61f0fdc57d5496977311585e7a599 (02:15): you need to press the Apply button in the modifier",
        "984724c86e0fca843250d6eda9056728 (02:16): Ok suppose you have a body in the leonardo pose",

        "d6e61f0fdc57d5496977311585e7a599 (02:16): then it will make them real poly's",
        "984724c86e0fca843250d6eda9056728 (02:16): you border select the left half",

        "d6e61f0fdc57d5496977311585e7a599 (02:18): Shaba1, heh, it's sooo much easier to just apply a mirror modifier to it",

        "984724c86e0fca843250d6eda9056728 (02:18): then you mirror it around the x axis",

        "984724c86e0fca843250d6eda9056728 (02:18): now you have it in the same place as the left half",

        "984724c86e0fca843250d6eda9056728 (02:19): so you need to G key to grab it and x key to move it only in the global x direction",
