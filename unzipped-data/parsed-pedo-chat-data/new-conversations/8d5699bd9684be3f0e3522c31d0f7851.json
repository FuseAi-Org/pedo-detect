        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:13): That's odd. It really shouldn't.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:13): Do you get more than that using the command line client?",
        "0dc66832b1f71564bf53893f388a2e4f (06:13): i'll try, thanks",
        "0dc66832b1f71564bf53893f388a2e4f (06:21): I can insert more rows over 256 in the command line and with sqlite browser, a qt3 app",
        "0dc66832b1f71564bf53893f388a2e4f (06:22): but still, my app in qt4 cannot insert, if i have less than 256 rows everything inserts fine",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:28): Strange.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:28): I'm working on a Qt4 SQLite app myself so if I can reproduce your problem I'll be sure to document it.",
        "0dc66832b1f71564bf53893f388a2e4f (06:33): ahigerd: have you ever tried inserting a row after you have 256 or more in the database?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:34): No, I haven't; currently my app is read-only.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:34): The editor will get written a little later.",
        "44f76762d837de6adc8900ece7ab6b7b (06:57): is there a way to make a QPushButton draw its pixmap AND its text?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:58): Should be; I seem to remember talking to someone about it and they were complaining that they drew the pixmap to the left of the text instead of above it.",
        "cd163c8ced276359d763ec1a31301a42 (07:00): rideout: if you can demonstrate that in an example app, please send it to <email/> :)",
        "0dc66832b1f71564bf53893f388a2e4f (07:03): ljp: will do",
        "cd163c8ced276359d763ec1a31301a42 (07:03): if it is a bug, its a recent change, as in earlier qtopia, there was an thing doing 20,000 rows",
        "cd163c8ced276359d763ec1a31301a42 (07:03): and we had no problem",
        "0dc66832b1f71564bf53893f388a2e4f (07:05): I think it might have to do with table locking somehow",
        "0dc66832b1f71564bf53893f388a2e4f (07:05): i was finally able to get an error that made sense",
        "44f76762d837de6adc8900ece7ab6b7b (07:07): ahigerd: as soon as you set a pixmap for a button, apparently, it wipes out its text",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:07): loquitus_of_borg: Can you then set the text again afterward?",
        "44f76762d837de6adc8900ece7ab6b7b (07:08): ahigerd: I could but then there is also a possibility that alot of other things are done differently in the drawing process if the pixmap is defined... it is possible the text is totally ignored if I set the pixmap",
        "44f76762d837de6adc8900ece7ab6b7b (07:08): ahigerd: you think I should try?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:08): Worth a shot; come on, compiling doesn't take that long.",
        "44f76762d837de6adc8900ece7ab6b7b (07:09): ahigerd: yep. works. but as soon as I set the text, the pixmap goes bye bye",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:10): Hmm...",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:10): Out of curiosity, what kind of behavior do you get with QToolButton?",
        "44f76762d837de6adc8900ece7ab6b7b (07:11): ahigerd: never used it before",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:11): It's a QAbstractButton subclass just like QPushButton; functionality and API are identical.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:11): Might give it a try.",
        "44f76762d837de6adc8900ece7ab6b7b (07:15): ahigerd: ah ok.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:32): loquitus_of_borg: Any luck?",
        "ffb5495be51d875e08561c595420f6a2 (07:32): I've somewhat of a newbie question, how do I close my QMainWindow with the esc key?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:32): DarkPhantom: That's not really a newbie question.",

        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:33): Normally you use QDialog if you want that functionality.",
        "ffb5495be51d875e08561c595420f6a2 (07:33): well .. I want my app to be easy to close ..",
        "44f76762d837de6adc8900ece7ab6b7b (07:33): ahigerd: actually what I ended up doing was just using the qPainter's draw text function to draw the text on right after the button is drawn. it almost works except when the button is in a down state, the text is not shifted",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:33): If you seriously need QMainWindow and you've already got a menu bar, try adding a &quot;Close&quot; menu item with Esc as a shortcut",
        "ffb5495be51d875e08561c595420f6a2 (07:33): is there any reason I need to really be using QMainWindow .. or would  a QDialog do for 90% of the uses?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:34): QMainWindow is if you need a menu bar or dockable widgets.",
        "ffb5495be51d875e08561c595420f6a2 (07:34): hmm .. I see",
        "ffb5495be51d875e08561c595420f6a2 (07:34): I'll try the menu item",
        "ffb5495be51d875e08561c595420f6a2 (07:35): (and I figured its a newbie question since I've been using qt for .. duno .. a week)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:35): Nah, I encountered the same thing.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (07:36): You can implement that behavior yourself with a shortcut key or by using keyPressEvent",
        "ffb5495be51d875e08561c595420f6a2 (07:36): I don't know much about that whole aspect of qt yet .. guess its about time to dive into that anyways",
        "ffb5495be51d875e08561c595420f6a2 (07:37): I don't suppose ther's a way to not actually visually use a QAction, but have its shortcut work is there?",
