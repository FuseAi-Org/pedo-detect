        "08c1245f70464580d6323e90f7b902f2 (03:20): thinks it would make good starter lyrics for a folk-rock song",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:28): isn't name=&quot;&quot; on &lt;iframe&gt; missing? (opera supports id=&quot;&quot;, but firefox and ie don't)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:29): possibly",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:31): if we want &lt;a target&gt; and &lt;form taget&gt; to work with iframes then we need &lt;iframe name&gt;, i think",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:33): should i mail the list?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:34): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: sure",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:34): and thanks",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:34): does it need to be conforming? prolly...",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:35): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: &lt;a target&gt; is conforming, what use is it if you can't use it together with iframes?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:35): i meant &lt;iframe name&gt;",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:35): much like &lt;map name&gt;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:36): &lt;map&gt; works with id. &lt;iframe&gt; doesn't",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:36): the former doesn't in Firefox",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:37): but it does in ie. the latter doesn't in both firefox and ie.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:38): Firefox has like 10% market share...",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:38): If working is an argument, &lt;map name&gt; should certainly be conforming",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:38): not against that",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:39): they should be handled in a consistent way imo",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:39): same for &lt;object id/name&gt; etc.",
        "0ee1faace5e2a5be841794d5df0eda43 (03:40): I think it's preferrable to have only id be conforming if there aren't any major UAs where name works but id doesn't for some construct",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:41): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: &lt;iframe id&gt; doesn't work in ie nor firefox (don't know about safari)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:42): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: yeah, I'm just making a broad generalization based on what edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e said",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:42): I don't know what the situation is with object id/name",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:46): well, i guess i need to do more testing here first then",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:46): not today though",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:46): :-)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:54): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46, what does http://xhtml.se/2007/04/17/x-and-html-sitting-in-a-tree/ say?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:57): It's basically saying &quot;Now that HTML and XHTML will be the same in v5, it won't matter which one you use&quot;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:57): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: it basically says that html5 is the future, and that it doesn't matter if you use xhtml1 or html4 today, and it is pointless to switch from xhtml1 to html4, and pointless to argue about why xhtml is bad/shouldn't be used",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:58): yeah",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:58): blah",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:58): It fails to address the non-HTML aspects",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:58): if he means XHTML as text/html though, fair enough",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:58): Like mime-types, CSS background, you know the list better than me",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (03:58): is that made explicit?",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (03:59): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: he does, although he also likes content negotiation and mobile stuff",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:59): He doesn't mention it in the article itself, though",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:00): he will hold a presentation about xhtml at geekmeet together with my html5 presentation next month",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:00): Seems to be a defense for people using xhtml, rather than saying xhtml is good :)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:00): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: indeed, i just know because i've talked with him about it a lot",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:00): &quot;Look, I'm right after all!&quot;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:02): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: i don't think it's benefitical to argue against these guys. he's not alone. making html5 accept xhtmlish syntax makes them happy. :)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:03): I'm not arguing, I'm just making fun of them :)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:03): he's not ignorant at all, i just think he sticks to the xhtml idea because he bought the domain name ;)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:03): ok",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:03): lol",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:04): Wow",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:04): Now it's &quot;why not a namespace on the html element&quot;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:06): cwilso also thought it would be appropriate to use the namespace as a versioning switch, didn't he?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:06): ouch",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:10): http://www.w3.org/mid/<email/>",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:11): crazy",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:11): same as the nonsense people supporting that idea",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:14): I think cwilso doesn't want a version attribute because he (probably correctly) thinks people will just leave it off",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:15): That's counter to his other line of arguments, that people copy the header cargo cultishly",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:15): no, he pointed out 50% of sites leave off the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:17): Yes, but he also argues that many sites who opt for standards mode don't really want standards mode, so we could never have a real &quot;give me the latest and best&quot; switch",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (04:19): As a web developer, I find Chris' implication that those of us who use Strict DOCTYPEs to get standards mode now aren't competent enough to want &quot;always standards mode&quot; offensive",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:19): XHTML has taught us a lot of people will say it without meaning it, though :/",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:19): it seems to me that Microsoft having such major bugs that were left around for years is a major contributing factor to the breakage level",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (04:20): the incompetence of others shouldn't reflect on the whole",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (04:21): MS actually needs to do some real work and research each change on a case by case basis, rather than ruling them all out at once",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:23): And not fix the &quot;solution bugs&quot; before the problems that depend on it",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:23): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: they will only do that if they become a minority vendor and the web will ignore their versioning switches and work better on the competitor's browsers",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:23): i think",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:23): competitors' even",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (04:24): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: yes, it's quite sad",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (04:25): so that scenario is what we should aim for then :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (04:27): Perhaps the HTML5 spec should add an author conformance requirement that all pages must end in &lt;a href=&quot;http://getfirefox.com&quot;&gt;Get Firefox!&lt;/a&gt;",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:28): right",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:29): what about opera.com",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (04:29): we actually implemented WF2!",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:29): It should rotate",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (04:31): opera.com doesn't have enough swooshy blue and orange bits :-(",
