        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:42): from like a year back ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:42): (i wish they would implement it, i need it ;-) )",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:42): sounds about right",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:42): maybe 9 months?",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:43): seems to suggest that it's implemented in 3-4 browsers' beta versions, w/ reasonable polyfills",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:43): to tide us over",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:43): not aware of any beta implementations, but that would be nice",

        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:47): I was looking at about 3 various specs yesterday, and forgot which I had mentioned in here",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:47): shouldn't be that hard to make a shim for scrollPathIntoView()",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:47): pretty easy if you limit yourself to rects, anyway",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:47): like element.scrollIntoView()",

        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:48): same as for any polygon, for that matter",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (06:48): bezier curves get a bit trickier",
