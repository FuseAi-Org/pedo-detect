        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (22:22): hi 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e - do you have a moment for an AppCache question?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:22): sure",
        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (22:23): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I can't understand what this note means: &quot;The Document with which the ApplicationCache object is associated can only itself be associated with an 62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fcplication cache if it is in a top-level browsing context.&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:23): it's a lie",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:24): yeah",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:29): e.g. a document downloaded by XHR",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:29): there's always a resource being downloaded when the algorithm is invoked",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:29): sure, it's invoked by the HTML parser",
        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (22:30): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: ah well, it's just that we don't parse HTML there, only XML",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:30): with xhr2 you will",
        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (22:31): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: am I right that document.write cannot be used to make an html tag with a manifest?",
        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (22:33): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: as for &quot;there's always a resource being downloaded when the algorithm is invoked&quot; - what about XMLParser?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:34): document.write() could be used to generate a manifest if the docment was document.open()ed first, iirc",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:34): as in, if it all came from document.write()",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:34): but if you see a &lt;script&gt; tag then you can no longer document.write() the &lt;html&gt; tag",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:34): what about XMLParser?",

        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (22:36): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: same for document.write, as you just explained",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:36): (actually come to think of if document.open() wouldn't be part of navigation so it wouldn't trigger this)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:37): (it would trigger the If clause you asked about -- the &quot;do nothing&quot; one)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:37): in all the cases where you hit the mentions of &quot;resource being loaded&quot;, there is a resource being loaded",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:37): because if there wasn't, you would hit the first If clause and bail out",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:43): how can there be no resource?",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:48): What's the best way to loop over an object (?\u2020 la for\u201a\u00c4\u00b6in) but sorted in JS?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:53): 62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc: i'm just using it in the dictionary sense of &quot;asset&quot;",
        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (22:54): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: so, if a Document created with createDocument is a resource - is any Element a resource, too?",
        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (22:54): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: to me, a resource is something that can be loaded",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:54): 62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc: *shrug* what terminology would you rather we use here?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:56): i guess i can do that",
