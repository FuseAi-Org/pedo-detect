        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:48): idk if i have time though with school and sports",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:49): well, it&apos;s worth it, regardless",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:49): true",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:50): so, what are you up to, besides random junk kicks?",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:50): lol bored as fuck xD but then again that&apos;s why i went with the random kicks xD i&apos;ve never actually hit a guy there except once on accident lol",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:51): well,  maybe I&apos;ll try the random boob punch",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:51): &gt;.&gt;",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:51): that&apos;ll get you kicked repeatedly",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:51): for like an hour",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:52): or just castrated",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:52): ha ha",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:52): i think the relative pain from a ball kick to a boob punch is much higher",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:53): probably lol every guy ive seen get hit there went down like right off lmfao. that&apos;s why i felt so bad when i accidently hit my friend there lol. i&apos;m glad i&apos;m a girl :P lol but a boob punch does hurt like a bitch. just maybe not as bad as balls would lol",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:54): no where near... i would imagine.... as I don&apos;t possess boobs",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:55): lol yea. probably not close. but still. guys shouldnt hit girls anyway. especially not in the boobs. it might not hurt as bad. but hitting a girl in the boobs might as well ask for a kick in the balls",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:55): I agree.  neither one should happen unprovoked",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:56): true. most of the time it happens to guys though they deserve it. not always. but most of the time. unless it&apos;s an accident. but it&apos;s a lot easier to accidently hit a guy there than it is to hit a girl in the boobs",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:57): hmm....",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:57): don&apos;t know about that",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:57): see I would always think that considering the placement of boobs, they would be more likely to incur damage",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (03:58): also.... size would play an important role",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:58): well yea..but like i could just be walking and swing my hand a little to far. and hit him there on accident",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (03:59): thats true too lol. boobs are a lot bigger than balls lmfao. i guess it just seems that way because if a girl is hit in the boob it hurts but like she doesn&apos;t really go down and show she&apos;s in pain like a guy would from being hit there",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:00): yeah. true.  if you apply the same force of impact to both body parts, the girl will just get angry, the guy will be incapacitated.",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:01): lol yea. i heard that girls have a higher tolerance for pain though. which helps",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:01): yeah, I don&apos;t know about that",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:01): maybe it&apos;s certain types of pain",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:02): the whole having a baby pain.... scares the piss out of me",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:02): it&apos;s been scientifically proven that girls have a higher tolerance for pain lol",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:02): hmm.... fair enough",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:02): can&apos;t argue with science",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:02): and yea...it hurts like a bitch lol. i kinda had a kid x: i kinda made some bad choices when i was younger",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:03): i can only imagine",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:03): but it&apos;s supposed to be like a guy pulling his scrotum over the back of his head apparently....if that helps",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:03): oh the mental pictures",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:04): well, I hope you&apos;re doing better now, btw.",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:04): yea lol it was 2 years ago lol. i&apos;m fine now. my son means everything to me. it was worth it in the end",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:04): thanks though :)",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:04): I&apos;m sure",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:05): so, you did have a child?",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:05): yep",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:05): i have a 2 year old son",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:05): that&apos;s commendable",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:05): idk what that means lol",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:05): i really respect you for choosing to have him",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:06): yea. im not for abortion....i think it&apos;s fucked up personally",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:06): as do I",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:07): but yea. i love kids anyway. i don&apos;t think it was good to have him at such a young age...but what&apos;s done is done. and my live is better now because of it.",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:08): that&apos;s good",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:08): yep",

        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:09): any tips?",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:10): idk really lol. idk like what the normal dad would do with a child. just really go by your instincts",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:11): is the dad still in the picture?",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:12): btw,  I&apos;ve talked with lots of people who haven&apos;t ready any books",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:12): no. he left when i was pregnant and actually was shot and killed about 3 months into my pregnancy",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:13): oh no!",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:13): that&apos;s crazy",

        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:15): lmfao ikr. well it was all pain related? lol",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:16): correct",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:17): so, what else is pain related?",
        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:18): idk? that&apos;s kinda like the extreme for both genders though? birth and getting hit in the balls? lol i guess that&apos;s why it was brought up",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:19): agreed",
        "f9024e70c6470c40d56e1ab3f43bff62 (04:19): hmm.....",

        "1da2f2b4fa6d13bb3dc1151604c8d77f (04:22): other than that? probably well. when i got beat by the guy who is my son&apos;s dad. or was? he beat me when he found out i was pregnant then he left. thankfully the baby survived though"
