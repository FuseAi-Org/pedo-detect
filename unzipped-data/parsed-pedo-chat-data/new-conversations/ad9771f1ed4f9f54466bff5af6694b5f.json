        "c88ae1780925de771a119169ef9deb1b (00:48): Anyone know of a motherboard that supports RIMM memory and has pci express ?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (00:50): RIMM?... haven't they died a death yet?",
        "c88ae1780925de771a119169ef9deb1b (00:51): I thought I read something about the technology being used again, but I'm asking cause somebody I know still wanted to keep using the rimm modules he has",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (00:51): ShredZ: Last RDRAM chipset I heard of was some SiS POS and that was well before PCI Express came out",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (00:51): ShredZ: tell your friend that ditching his RDRAM setup for a dual-channel DDR or DDR2 setup is long overdue",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (00:52): RIMM is always making a comeback cause that's the only way RAMBUS can stay aflote",

        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (00:53): even at it peek dual channel RIMM wasn't good enough to beat dual channel DDR",

        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (00:57): intel had a contact with rambus not to offer ddr till 2004?",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (00:57): something like that",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (00:57): that's why some p4's came with pc100/133",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (00:58): flyback: single channel DDR, the dual-channel variant didn't come to PCs until the original nForce chipset",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (00:58): oh dual channel mabye",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (00:58): RDRAM was faster than pretty much everything else around at the time, what killed it more than anything else was greed on Rambus' part",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:03): uhh and latency",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:03): it's like cas12",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (01:08): LSD`: and people wanting to run large amounts of RAM quickly... RDRAM suffered from the fact it's a long long serial bus so the more ram you had the higher the latency... exactly the oposite of what was required",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (01:08): and dual channel PC2700 kinda kicked RDRAM in the balls",

        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (01:12): StoneNewt: I did say &quot;at the time&quot;, the amount of RAM you needed to get shit done at the height of RDRAM was a lot less than it is today and also, dual-channel PC2700 DDR RAM didn't come out until after RDRAM on the desktop was long dead",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (01:14): LSD`: so that's why we were using dual channel DDR333 during the hight of RDRAM in non-PCs... also with more than 2GB of ram :p",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (01:14): a combernation that left the P4s looking ultra jaded",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (01:15): even with CPUs delivering 30~50% less power :(",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (01:22): According to JEDEC, DDR333 didn't start appearing until about 2002, RDRAM in PCs was well dead by then"
