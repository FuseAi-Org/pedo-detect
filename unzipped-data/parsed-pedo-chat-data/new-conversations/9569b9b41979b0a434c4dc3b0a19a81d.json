        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (12:23): I have a question related to html5 drag and drop, section 6.8.4.2",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (12:25): how can the drag source know the draganddrop succeeded but on the desktop ?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (12:26): I want my script, from onDrop on the source, to perform a special operation in that case",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (12:39): funny, 3 out of 5 WHATWG demos are obsolete per latest thinking",

        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (12:43): I think i'll send it to the mailing-list",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (12:45): bonjour, dunno much about d&amp;d",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:45): d&amp;d isn't my area, either",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (12:45): there is this demo though: http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/dnd/dnd.html",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:16): 72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d: just replied to your message",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:16): thanks 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:17): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, you can't use mouse events...",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:17): you're outside of the window !",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:17): you don't even get the evens",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:17): events",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:17): right, hence the capture API",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:17): exactly but it's not here yet",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:17): (the idea is the (new) method would make it so all mouse events until the button is released would go to the element you pick, instead of the real target)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:17): correct, there's no real solution for this today",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:18): even with that API, you still couldn't position or scale the window, so you couldn't do, e.g., what chrome or safari do with dragging of tabs",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:18): sigh",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:18): yep",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:18): is missing this right now in FF",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:18): that's probably more something for css animation and css transform though",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:19): at least the scaling and animation aspects",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:19): I guess the &quot;detach sidebar item&quot; menuitem is all I can do for the time being :-(",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:19): the window positioning, i don't know",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:19): part of the problem is that we're somewhat moving away from letting web authors control windows",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:19): e.g. i see what chrome does with window.open() to be the way forward for window.open()",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:19): which is in-tab",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:20): i'd expect things like docking, snapping, and dragging of ui elements to be a ua-level feature rather than webapp-level",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (13:21): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: never heard of Prism or Adobe Air ? web-apps are ua-level these days...",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:21): even with prism (or apps generated by &lt;bb type=makeapp&gt; in html5) the apps are still webapps, so they're still sandboxed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:22): adobe air apps are privileged, so they're not subject to the limitations (and they're as dangerous as native apps)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:35): I don't think we'd want to give Safari standalone web apps any special privs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:48): it's quite amusing how much of wf2 is written defensively. it's almost like a manifesto in places rather than a spec.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:49): yet another way in which it is too reactive against XForms",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:49): yeah"
