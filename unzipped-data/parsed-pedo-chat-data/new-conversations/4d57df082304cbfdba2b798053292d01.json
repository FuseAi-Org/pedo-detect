        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:41): hmm, now all I need is something to convert 48v to 12v, that doesn't have a high standby current like these HUGE 48-&gt;12/5 switchers I have.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:41): they draw somewhere in the ballpark of 2 watts dead idle.",
        "a717b529be3ed555e1b433c2f6981013 (23:43): who helps me with MAC on my PPC ???",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (23:43): 48v to 12v are going to have relatively huge draws, nature of the beast. Unless you do it yourself, with a stack of voltage regulators",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:44): yeah...  my favorite switching regulator only does up to 40VIN",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:45): <a href=\"http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM2576.html\">http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM2576.html</a>",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:45): I've used those in all sorts of stuff...  They're a bit expensive on coils (its a 52khz device) but its fairly impossible to screw up, or make unstable due to board layouts or similar, like with higher speed switchers.",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (23:46): from the chart, looks like it'll run 48 just fine, you just need to heatsink the crap out of it.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:46): yeah",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:47): the chart shows to 60V, but the device says IMAX = 40 Volts",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:47): ahh, theres an HV version that does 60v",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (23:47): yeah, but I expect that's for the environmental constraints.",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (23:47): Try it, you'll find out.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:47): the only problem with that device is its been EOL'd by most fols.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:48): Wide input voltage range, 40V up to 60V for HV version",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (23:48): call national up, and ask'em for a dozen for a 'project',",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (23:48): national used tobe good about giving 'em up.",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (23:49): I expect they still are.",

        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:51): ugh 7 pin to220...  these 5 pins are hard enough to work with.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:52): oh well, I think I can work with it for a one-time shot.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:53): I don't expect to be building a battery box more than once per tower.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:53): the smaller repeaters I threw a small UPS on, if the power is out chances are everyone else connected to it is out too.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:54): what this world needs is a webpage where everyone registers the chips they keep onhand and prices....",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:55): theres probably 5000+ of those devices onhand between Dallas and Houston, but finding the distro that has them",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (23:57): oh poopy on it, I'll just use these huge switchers I bought in the past...",
