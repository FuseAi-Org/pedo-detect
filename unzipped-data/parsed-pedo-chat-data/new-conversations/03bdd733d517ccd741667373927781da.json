        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (15:37): on gareth hay's point about making the web better and html5 not doing that, aiui a better web is one that conforms to the w3c standards (largely) this is manifested by people running their site through the w3c validator and proving it's valid, no-one ever links to the actual standard always to the validator",
        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (15:37): so make a validator that complies with the 'good and proper' recommendations in html5",

        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (15:38): but is that not correct, no-one ever points to the actual spec to say they are valid, always to the validator results?",

        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (15:41): well, from my now developing point of view i don't think there's any need for two specs, just one from which a 'good and proper html' conformance checker can be built",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (15:42): see for instance the syntax section",

There are plenty of standards that they were involved in that they don't implement (either at all, or properly).",
