The  \nSpeaker 2    00:00:11    Cleanest best pleasure is  \nSpeaker 3    00:00:13    To have sex with a 13-year-old girl. Yes, sir.  \nSpeaker 4    00:00:15    Tonight they're back. A string of suspects targeting children. It's another undercover sting.  \nSpeaker 5    00:00:22    It's funny when I saw this on Dateline, that is so sick.  \nSpeaker 4    00:00:28    A dateline net crime to catch a predator like moss to a flame. They just keep coming. Thanks for joining us. I'm Stone Phillips.  \nSpeaker 6    00:00:36    And I'm Man Curry. It has been more than two years now since we first began our series of reports investigating online sex predators. Five different states, 129 men exposed  \nSpeaker 4    00:00:47    Tonight. Investigation number six. This time we've set up our hidden cameras and a rented house in rural Georgia. And once again, even men who have seen our reports show up at the door. We should let you know that some of what you will see and hear is explicit. Here's Chris Hansen.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:04    I got an update on Scooby Dee's car. He's gonna be in an orange Ford Explorer  \nSpeaker 2    00:01:09    On this stormy summer night on a winding country road. A potential sex predator slowly approaches a house where he believes a child is waiting for him. He's driven a long way for this meeting. Almost two hours.  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:22    There he is. There he is.  \nSpeaker 2    00:01:24    But the driver won't find a young girl inside. Instead, a Dateline investigative team awaits his arrival all. I  \nSpeaker 0    00:01:31    Mean, he's coming in.  \nSpeaker 2    00:01:32    Why is this man making such a long trip in the dead of night? Perhaps because he believes a 15-year-old girl is alone inside, ready to have sex with him.",

It began more than a week earlier when he entered a Yahoo, Georgia chat room and decided to hit on a decoy, an adult posing as a 15-year-old. It didn't take long for the 23-year-old screen named Scooby-Doo a TL oh one, to steer the chat towards sex. He asked all kinds of sexual questions like, what positions have you tried? You like doggy. The decoy says, I never did doggy before. And Scooby-Doo says, well, if we ever have sex, I'll introduce it to you. But I switch positions a lot. So you're bound to learn a few new tricks. Now the man with the bag of tricks is walking in our house. We hired a very young looking 19-year-old to play the part of the girl.  \nSpeaker 3    00:02:32    Hey, hey. Take you a while to get here. Yeah,  \nSpeaker 7    00:02:36    Well, it only can't get good directions of where they  \nSpeaker 3    00:02:38    Live. I taking outta the dryer. It'll take a second. Some sweet tea. You can say, I gotta finish shaking his stuff out.  \nSpeaker 2    00:02:54    You'd never guess. By the way, this man confidently walks into our house that he's seen datelines investigations into internet sex predators before, and he's still willing to risk being exposed on national television. Did you have a hard time finding the place or, yeah,  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:09    Man.  \nSpeaker 2    00:03:10    You got lost, huh? Yeah.  \nSpeaker 1    00:03:12    Who are you?

Dateline paid perverted justice, a consultant's fee to do what it usually does, go into chat rooms, posing his 13 to 15 year olds home alone, interested in sex. Some decoys pretend to be eager about sex. That's because experts we've spoken to say young teens are often curious, even precocious when it comes to chatting online about sex without knowing the potential lifelong repercussions of being molested by an adult. I don't know if anybody's in chat. While it's encouraging to hear our investigations have scared off some potential child molesters, others like Scooby-Doo, ATL oh one, obviously didn't get the message.

His chat with a girl he thinks is 14, is so graphic. Much of it can't be shown. He does ask the decoy if her house is secluded. So if they use the jacuzzi, you can moan and squeal all you want.
