        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:23): http://www.w3.org/mid/<email/>",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:25): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I get 404",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:26): http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/2007Sep/0028.html seems to work",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:26): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - hmm, I got 404 the message ID link too",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:26): dunno why",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:27): anyway, &quot;using tables for layout is absolutely bad&quot; seems to me another in the list of dogmatic/religious principles that many people have just unquestionaly accepted, as if it's axiomatic",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:28): yeah",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:32): even more axiomatic is the notion that tables are so bad that even CSS tables are bad",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:32): http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2002Feb/0125.html",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:33): heh",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:35): I guess there's some consistency in that position at least.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:37): I mean, I wonder if you were to ask many don't-use-tables-for-layout advocates why it's OK to use CSS tables instead, they might have a hard time giving you a sensible explanation",
        "0c2de4934c6d7fc96160344dec846df3 (15:37): I'd suspect many would be able to put forth the notion that CSS doesn't pretend to hold any _meaning_",
        "8276c305beb1ebf1529fb8592cb24083 (15:38): The don't-use-table-for-layout people are responsible for a lot of work and jobs though :)",
        "0c2de4934c6d7fc96160344dec846df3 (15:39): Of course, practically speaking tables (whether CSS or HTML) are bad just because doing major maintaining on a website with them is hell.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:39): 0c2de4934c6d7fc96160344dec846df3: if you are a markup consumer, you are better off not trusting that tables have meaning",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:39): of course, this fails sometimes",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:40): like in Opera for Mobile one of the subtables in reittiopas.fi results would be better unlinearized",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:40): but still, most of the time, linealization is a better guess",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:41): now, making site authors cooperate by getting rid of layout tables is unrealistic",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:42): flagging real data tables in what might actually work",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:43): the table layout model is useful",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:43): (on large displays)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:44): and doing it in CSS only has a bad compat story with legacy browsers and even the current IE",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:46): from the HTML5 draft: &quot;Big Issue: we need some editorial text on how layout tables are bad practice and non-conforming&quot;",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:47): 0c2de4934c6d7fc96160344dec846df3: maintaining a complex float system isn't exactly non-hell",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:48): and positioning severely sucks from the user perspective",
        "8276c305beb1ebf1529fb8592cb24083 (15:48): I'd say that's more hell :)",
        "0c2de4934c6d7fc96160344dec846df3 (15:48): I don't know - Maybe my mind is wired weirdly, but I find float layouts far easier to conceptualize and maintain than I ever did for tables.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:50): also, some well-intentioned float layout are actually worse than table-based layouts in cases where the ratio of the font size and the viewport width is unexpected to the author",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:50): for example, if you have 800px wide screen and 20px font size on N800",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:50): because float sites tend to fix the size of a sidebar in ems",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:51): and leave the rest to content",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:51): well, sucks to be the user when the content column shrinks close to zero",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:56): maybe we can rename the table element to &quot;box&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:56): then we could call it the &quot;box model&quot;",
        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (15:56): i've often wondered why we shun tables for layout when they accurately map to a design grid",
        "8276c305beb1ebf1529fb8592cb24083 (16:02): To help CSS (or standards aware) developers get a job",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (16:04): as as far as CSS tables, the argument for not using tables for layout would be a lot more compelling if IE supports CSS tables; but as long as IE doesn't, it's pretty unrealistic to expect that anyone can convince most authors to completely avoid using table markup for layout purposes",
        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (16:23): i probably should rephrase what i said there..."
