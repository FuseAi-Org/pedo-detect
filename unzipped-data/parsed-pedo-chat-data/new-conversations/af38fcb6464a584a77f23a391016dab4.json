        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:03): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: so what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the point of them then?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:04): They use the URL mechanism to provide global uniqueness",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:04): aah ok",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:05): The URL might point to a 404, which is fine",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:06): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I kinda thought that as microdata is machine-readable a program could theoretically reference the itemid to learn about a new vocabulary, but that seems forbidden. how does that affect machine readibility",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:06): though it shouldn't point to a non-existent domain because there's nothing to stop someone else picking the same non-existent domain",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:07): You can parse microdata without needing to know the vocabulary",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:07): (which is probably its main benefit over microformats)",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:07): yep",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:08): and I don't think there were compelling use cases for writing tools that process parsed data from vocabularies they know nothing about",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:08): aah ok",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (14:08): Non-dereferencable URLs is probably the most futile effort ever",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:09): so it wasn't considered important to support that",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:10): I was asking Manu about microdata vocabularies and heard that RDFa vocabs can be used (with URLs as names) but that microdata vocabularies have to be defined in spec. that 2nd part doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seem right because e.g. Google\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s data-vocabulary.org vocabs",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (14:11): Yup.",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (14:12): Yes, as long as you specify them somewhere",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:12): huh. was wondering if i was missing something there for a while :)",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (14:12): It's just authoring conformance, it doesn't actually matter in processing",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:12): wonder why he said that",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:13): As far as I'm aware, you can define microdata vocabularies however you want and write machine-readable versions in whatever format you want and then code them into your microdata-using application and associate them with the item type identifier",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:14): so that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why you can use RDFa vocabs too huh",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:14): wow",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:14): nice",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:15): I think RDFa is designed to tie in with RDFish ways of defining vocabularies; microdata is designed to not care about that problem and merely to provide a tree of data that you can interpret however you want",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:17): now wondering how to write dereferenced URL in a way that normal ppl would understand :) a uniqueness token? hmm",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:18): Dereferenced URL?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:18): That's just a resource :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:18): (unless you're an HTTP person in which case it's a representation)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:19): Do you mean something like non-dereferenceable URL instead?",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:20): eg \u201a\u00c4\u00faNote that the URL is only a unique vocabulary identifier \u201a\u00c4\u00ee it doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t actually have to have any content\u201a\u00c4\u00f9",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:20): Maybe it'd be best to give examples",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:20): (URL being the value of itemtype=&quot;&quot;)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:21): like say it can be &quot;http://n.whatwg.org/whatever&quot; even though there's not a page (or even a domain) there",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (14:21): Just not necessarily",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:22): and say that's a completely different item type from &quot;http://n.whatwg.org/whatever/&quot; since they're different strings even if they might happen to be equivalent when used as URLs",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:23): or something like that",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:24): huh",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (14:26): &quot;note that the URL is only a unique vocabulary identifier. Some vocabularies may use URLs that go somewhere, but for microdata purposes it's just a string with no special meaning (&quot;opaque identifier&quot;).",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:28): 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: The URLs are compared as strings. The resembelence to URLs you use to access resources on the web is either a) useful or b) dangerously misleading, depending on your point of view",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:28): 4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b: thanks for the suggestion",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:28): It could be useful because the URL could point to some human-readable text explaining how to use the vocabulary",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:29): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: hehe, that seems to define a lot of HTML5 huh",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (14:29): yeah that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what Google vocabularies do, except for recipe",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:29): It could be dangrously misleading because you might think that http://foo.example and http://foo.example/ were the same",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:30): But they are not (since there is only string comparison)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:30): The reason that UAs must not automatically deference the URLs is that this constitutes a DDOS attack",
