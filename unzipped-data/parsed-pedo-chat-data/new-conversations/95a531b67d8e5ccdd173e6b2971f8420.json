        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (23:52): Hopefully we will use reftests for most other things",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:00): So, I'll be building a few harnesses.  First one is for self-describing tests, because they're the easiest.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:00): Then probably a js-test one using the framework that the testing WG is doing.",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:02): But there is also a html file that loads tests in iframes and allows you to mark the result",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:03): I think it will hook into the js at some point in the near future",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:03): e.g. for reftests if you can't actually provide automation (hard, requires proprietary APIs)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:04): you should at least provide a harness that allows you to view test, view ref, flip between the two, and mark the result",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:04): Right, reftests are a problem until we have dependable ability to draw DOM elements into canvas.",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:06): Mostly I don't think this is a big problem because vendors are working on their own reftest runners",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:06): Or have them already",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:06): Sure.  I think we all have the ability already, if we haven't built an actual runner for them.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:06): But you can't crowdsource a reftest runner.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:08): Letting arbitrary people run tests themselves and report results.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (00:08): Like browserscope and the 20+ other similar efforts.",
