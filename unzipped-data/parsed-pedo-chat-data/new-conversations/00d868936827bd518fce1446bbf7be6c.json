        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:15): surkov, I have a licensing question",

        "f5137d105ccd11d3c4384e8e8573b3c8 (14:15): sure",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:16): surkov, I wrote this algorithm for Levenshtein distance",
        "f5137d105ccd11d3c4384e8e8573b3c8 (14:16): hehe :)",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:16): surkov, it's now O(ND) N - shorter string, D - distance",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:16): it works this way in DIFF to my reckon",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:16): then",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:16): it's possible to make it even faster",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:16): to O(N + D^D)",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:17): D &lt;= N",

        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:17): but there are implementations",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:17): GPLed",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:17): of Ukkonen",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:17): I could use",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:17): (or at least I think)",

        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:19): ok, anyway, I'll make another approach before doing that",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:19): if I succeed, you will have the best implementation on the planed",

        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:20): but I'm not sure if that's the best usage of time :/, I should probably picked some easier one",
        "f5137d105ccd11d3c4384e8e8573b3c8 (14:20): that's amazing",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:20): that's creazy",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:21): the proof-of-concept is easy embeddable to code already",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:21): as I think of it right now",
        "f5137d105ccd11d3c4384e8e8573b3c8 (14:21): you get quite good experience that can be quite helpful",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:22): I hope. you know, my previous experience was in business, and my ex-boss would already kill me for not getting thing done previous week :D",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:22): so it's ok to spend like 30-40 hours on single bug?",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:22): I am 24 in already",
        "f5137d105ccd11d3c4384e8e8573b3c8 (14:23): well, you can do long-term and short-term things, Mozilla allows to do investments into future while it's reasonable",
        "f5137d105ccd11d3c4384e8e8573b3c8 (14:23): that depends on bug, some bugs require more time",
        "f5137d105ccd11d3c4384e8e8573b3c8 (14:24): this bug is specific, but I think it's ok if you spend that time for it",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:24): ok. I wanted to ask that to David today, but he's on holiday and he told me to ask you",

        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:29): tbsaunde, and generally, both linux and bsd userland uses lesser algorithms. this alg is from 95",

        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:30): tbsaunde, even on my faculty, where we have great text algorithms section, they just linked me to it, saying that there's nothing better to start with",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (14:30): askalski: I wouldn't be suprised if a normal user land didn't have any need for it",

        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:30): fortunately there are some implementations in python to cross-test against",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (14:31): askalski: fwiw by bsd I ;meant bsd license or alpha variants there of",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:32): tbsaunde, yeah I know. I found some private implementations, but now I think I'll just run with my own",
        "22625f683d3bf3dd883140da90753a5c (14:32): just try at least",
