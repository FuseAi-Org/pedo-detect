        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:39): and (b) there's an anybody/somebody/nobody risk, and action items are a good way to manage it",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:40): if you agree to something by email, there's little consequence to not doing it.",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:40): it would be nice to have this agenda sent to the list, with the various things i mentioned in my mail filled in for each one",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:41): most people feel pretty uncomfortable showing up to a teleconference empty-handed after they've promised to do something. At least: that's the way I'm used to getting groups to complete work.",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:41): yes, the agenda has to get sent to the list. let's return to your list of questions...",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:41): (every telecon people always turn up having not done their action items. same with the waf and other groups i'm in.)",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:42): umm... I take that sort of thing pretty seriously. If you agree to do something and then don't do it, I expect some explanation, and I don't let it go unnoticed.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:42): fair enough.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (01:42): I'm in the same all day meeting today and tomorrow and 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e.  (CSS f2f)",

        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:44): I'm aware that some groups have a pattern of action items with no progress week after week. that's no way to run a group, IMO.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:44): no disagreement from me there",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:44): if you don't get it done, I find somebody who will, or we decide together that it's not worth doing, or something.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (01:44): but if I do my CSS action items somebody will block the draft from being published, so why bother?",

        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:45): excellent. that's all I ask.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:45): 587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: would be nice to see the information for the items i mentioned in that mail for each action item, though, i think that would go a long way towards determining if the meetings are being a success",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:46): &quot;What problem the meeting is supposed to be fixing&quot; ... (a) we have agreed to produce an HTML spec, and we don't have one yet. further, many of us are not clear on which end of this WG is up, or where it's going.",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:46): [read (b) for &quot;further&quot; there, perhaps]",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:47): &quot;Why e-mail has failed to solve the issue, why a meeting is expected to solve the problem better&quot;. voice has all sorts of subtle clues that text doesn't give. whether somebody hesitates or not can say a lot.",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:47): also, a straw poll can be done in a few seconds rather than a few days",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:48): i meant those questions to be specific to the issues raised",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:48): to the agenda items, i mean",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:48): as opposed to general comparisons of audioconference vs e-mail vs irc, where each has pros and cons",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:48): hmm... so 5 questions per agendum? hmm...",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:49): well the answers would be different for each item, yeah",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:50): this order is getting taller... not unreasonable, but you're also asking for expedited service.",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:50): and we just used 20 of my 30 minutes. hm.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): well items 1 and 2 seem to have obvious answers",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): it's items 3 and 4 that are the &quot;work&quot; items",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:51): the biggest problem I see with trying to evaluate whether the meeting is a success is that there's no way to measure it. There's no way to answer &quot;how productive would the WG have been had we not had the meeting?&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:52): (items 5 and 6 being just about future meetings, which presumably would have the same process of going through these steps)",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:52): This is management, not engineering. I make up an answer, and we find out much later whether it's a good one.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:52): well, for example, something like:",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:52): &quot;if someone has volunteered to organise and lead an effort to review the html5 group with a deadline, then the meeting was a success&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:53): might be a good answer for your &quot;html5 review&quot; item",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:53): based on what you said earlier",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:53): er yes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:53): 587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef: ?",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (01:54): unfortunately, having an agenda is incompatible with having a hidden agenda, if you want to measure whether useful progress was made on teh agenda",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:54): when you're recruiting people to do work, sometimes it's best to let them offer before you ask in so many words.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:55): well you don't have to ask, but we still have to be clear about what the intent is",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (01:55): I think reviewing might be premature without understanding what output is expected from the review or what decisions, if any, we would base on it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:55): yeah",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (01:55): so I would not volunteer to lead it",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:55): I'll keep that in mind. but I also ask that to some extent, you trust me to do what, in my experience, is effective.",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (01:55): because I wouldn't know what my deliverable would be",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (01:56): yes, review might well be premature. that's why I want to discuss it by phone in a group setting... to get a feel for what people are comfortable with.",
