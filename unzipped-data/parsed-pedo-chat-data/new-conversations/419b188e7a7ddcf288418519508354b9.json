        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:54): 99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17, they were discussing On2's VP3 patent licensing issues in relation to implementing Theora",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (15:55): ah",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (15:55): and whether it covers independent reimplementations",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:56): it's not clear whether it only covers derivatives of the Xiph implementation, or any implementation",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:57): 99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17, discussion started around here http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090703#l-728",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:57): or maybe slightly before that",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (15:58): from what I know it should cover independent reimplementaton as the deal with On2 was done in that spirit. One can see current Theora as a non-VP3 related implementation, given it has been rewritten from scratch",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (15:58): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, thanks",

        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (15:59): I'll forward this",

        "e2633ed61085592add6e058692dfff2f (16:02): if it's a problem caused by two applets onthe page it sounds more like a jvm issue",

        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:08): mkay, it seems like any spec-compliant Theora product is derived from the original VP3 codebase simply because the spec was written from scratch with the VP3 source-code as input",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:09): there were zero pages of specification when the VP3/Theora deal was done",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:09): hmm. an implementation of the spec isn't a derivate work of the spec necessarily, is it?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:10): I thought the write-implementation-from-spec-written-from-implementation approach was often used as a way to *avoid* being considered a derivative",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:10): like in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design",

        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:12): I think nobody here is lawyer enough to settle that question. The only reliable source would be the actual agreement.",
