        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (19:53): decides to work on innerText first",

        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (20:02): Still, I want it to die",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:35): WebKit is insane too.  &lt;p&gt; adds two extra newlines, except if the margin is 7px it doesn't but if it's 8px it does, and &lt;div&gt; doesn't add two extra newlines no matter what its margins are . . .",
