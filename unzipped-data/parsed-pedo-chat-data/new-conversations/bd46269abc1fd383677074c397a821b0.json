        "caacdffd7a4aa3937fabe8e185e5165e (22:25): setActiveWindow or setCentralWidget?",
        "caacdffd7a4aa3937fabe8e185e5165e (22:26): use QMainWidget",

        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:28): I Was just following the guide. its my first day on Qt",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:28): There is no QMainWidget",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:28): so why does the guide say that!",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:28): That's a Qt3 guide and you're using Qt4.",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:28): the guide is for v3...",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:28): Use the Qt4 tutorials.",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:28): I'm running 4.1.4 . thats the only thing I can think of",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:28): oh; I found a really nice book on Qt3",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:28): That's exactly what it is; setMainWidget is a Qt3 function that's no longer needed in Qt4.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:29): The Blanchette book, yeah, we know.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:29): That's where all of the Qt3 programmers in here come from. :P",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:29): hahaha",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:29): do you happen to know of any nice Qt4 - just starting guides?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:29): Yeah, the one in Assistant or on doc.trolltech.com/4.1 is really good.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:29): Just work through the tutorial and you'll learn everything you need.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:30): (Assistant and the site are the same files)",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:30): oh I found a link on Qt's site to a PDF... thats what I was using..",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:30): Yeah, that's the Qt3 stuff. The Qt4 book by the same author hasn't been released in PDF yet, but you can buy the book at a bookstore.",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (22:30): I'm getting a stack of errors from the ui_*.h file generated from the .ui file? any standard newb errors that cause that?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:30): There IS another Qt4 book online: <a href=\"http://cartan.cas.suffolk.edu/moin/OopDocbook\">http://cartan.cas.suffolk.edu/moin/OopDocbook</a>",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:31): oh I was under the impression it wasnt out at all, thats' cool. hey thanks I'll have a look at the online documentation",
        "572f361dafadc97892b4f2331ba145b8 (22:31): and that too :p thanx",
        "caacdffd7a4aa3937fabe8e185e5165e (22:33): sry, qmainwidget* = qmainwindow*",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:35): QMainWindow isn't even the same thing.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:35): Qt3's setMainWidget means that when the main widget is closed, the app terminates.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:36): Qt4 doesn't need it because when all top-level widgets are closed, the app terminates.",

        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:42): Odd, looks like a missing include",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:44): Though I'd need to see the code that's triggering those errors (just a few lines would be enough) to guess at which one.",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (22:50): ahhh ok - will check if I just deleted it to try the wizard develop has for inheriting it..",
        "ea3f8a0223777fdf8d12983027629f14 (22:51): 'skyphyr' pasted &quot;odd error class file&quot;: <a href=\"http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1046\">http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1046</a>",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:52): Nah, I meant the parts of the ui_*.h file triggering those errors",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (22:52): oh :-) oops",
        "ea3f8a0223777fdf8d12983027629f14 (22:54): 'skyphyr' pasted &quot;the correct .h file&quot;: <a href=\"http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1047\">http://qtnode.net/pastebin/1047</a>",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:56): Aha!",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:56): Heh, that's your problem. &quot;continue&quot; is a reserved word in C++",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:56): Change your button's name.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:58): Also, looking at the code there, I can once again reaffirm my earlier statement about QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName()",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:58): It connects signals from named objects in the current object to the appropriately-named slots in the object in the parameter list. (For a multiple-inheritance object, you use &quot;this&quot; so both are the same object.)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:02): Actually, thinking about that more, it's actually even smarter than THAT",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:02): It doesn't use the &quot;current object&quot; because it's a static function -- it doesn't know about the &quot;current object.&quot;",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:03): Rather, setupUi() sets the parent for each widget to the parent widget, and the connectSlotsByName function simply connects all named children of the specified object to the appropriate slots.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:07): skyphyr: Any luck?",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:07): yeah - think I got it sorted",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:08): I dug through the .ui file - and there was a section where I'd put a combo and a list inside a layout - it had created a widget to put the layout in (didn't notice it) and I couldn't find a way to name it properly - it had called 3 of them all widget",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:08): after I changed those names so they were unique it worked",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:08): had to edit the .ui file by hand though",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:08): That's odd; I thought Designer understood sublayouts.",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:08): oh - I had a button named continue?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:08): Yeah.",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:08): how dumbass of me",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:09): will rename it as well",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:09): doh - just realised I'd killed my files",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:10): so no wonder it compiled fine",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:10): will try again - with the continue fixed and files added back in",
        "ce8a1609cf8d1a408da3cac46365f53e (23:17): ok the problem turns out to be a performance issue with xinerama displays. specifically this app runs extremely slow on xinerama displays, but not on regular X on the same hardware configuration.",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:21): that sorted it thanks ahigerd - had another one called delete - had to change it too",
        "8a9822ff0595044d78204c7678d53294 (23:21): you kinda forget things like that when you're working within a pretty gui like designer"
