        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:38): hello there",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:38): in regards to html5 coming from xhtml",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:39): i read in xhtml they put a trailing slash becuase of compatibility issues with some browsers",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:39): and i read that in html5 you dont need it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:39): like in &lt;br&gt; or &lt;img&gt;?",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:39): but it wouldnt be an issue if br hr meta still use it?",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:39): yeah &lt;br /&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; yeah &lt;img /&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:39): html5 lets you do it either like html4 or like xhtml, so you can do &lt;br&gt; or &lt;br/&gt;, doesn't matter",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:40): (the / is ignored)",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:40): cause i just converted www.truecarnage.org",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:40): it wasnt that much of a change but i kinda want to cater to both",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:40): is that possible?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:40): both what?",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:40): to do html5 and yet keep to standards im used to in xhtml?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:41): yes, you can do that, HTML5 allows you to include the /",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:41): in HTML5 you can do &lt;br/&gt; and it is valid",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:41): how much of html5 is usable now?",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:41): browser compatibility?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:42): pretty much all the stuff that was already in html4, as well as many other parts",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:42): there are guides on the web that discuss that in more detail",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:42): you guys deprecating &lt;dv&gt;?",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:42): &lt;div&gt;",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:43): &lt;section&gt; &lt;aside&gt; i read some stuff on that I will definitely read more on it",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:43): do you guys have icons for passing validation?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:44): &lt;div&gt; isn't deprecated, it should be used when you need something to hook some styles on",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:44): why did xhtml force transitional for &lt;iframe&gt; and target=&quot;_blank&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:44): no icons for passing validation, but we do have a validator at html5.validator.nu",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:44): dunno, that was another working group",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:44): html5 doesn't have a transitional anymore",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:44): and it allows &lt;iframe&gt; and target=&quot;&quot;",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:44): nice cause i like to use _blank and it would fail me on strict",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:45): i read w3c has accepted html5",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:45): and its still ok to specify the types of script and styles?",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:46): &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:46): you can, don't need to though",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:46): &lt;script&gt; is fine",
        "f9e12e0466f4d059b78bb3f863633092 (04:46): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e - will being a member of the HTMLwg help me get into the device api wg?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:47): f9e12e0466f4d059b78bb3f863633092: as far as i know it's just a mailing list, unless you want to call into the meetings (but i don't bother with that)",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:47): html5 is separate so there won't be a worry about bias towards browsers?",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:48): that would be the browser issue?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:48): how do you mean?",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:48): thats one huge reason i used xhtml",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:48): is that it tried to be ocmpatible",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:48): across browsers and devices",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:48): i wouldnt want to work with a language that favors IE or Safari or chrome",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:48): over another",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:48): html5 is significantly more compatible with browsers and devices than either XHTML or HTML4 ever were",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:49): cool so it wont be driven by browser its its own",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:50): one thing i notice in internet explorer 8, many sites have javascript errors",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:50): big sites",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:51): espn, even id's quakelive, fancast",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:51): that might have more to do with IE8 having bugs rather than the sites",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:51): i was wondering",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:51): IE8 doesn't do javascript (or rather, the DOM) in a very standards-compliant way",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:51): see e.g. how it does on acid3, which mostly tests DOM/JS stuff",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:52): how far are we from css3?",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (04:52): Is it correct to say there is no subset of valid HTML5 documents that would also validate as HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:52): no",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:52): www.truecarnage.org does",

        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (04:53): ah okay",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:53): a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0: css3 is a large number of specs, and i don't know how they are progressing, i'm out of touch with the css stuff these days",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:54): thats cool apreciate your prompt replies to the questions :)",
        "a81bb49f6a219ef0cc5aa48e9e3b0fe0 (04:54): i just worry about compatibility and proprietary stuff",
