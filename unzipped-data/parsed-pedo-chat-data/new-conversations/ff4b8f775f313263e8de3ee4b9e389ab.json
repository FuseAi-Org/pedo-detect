        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (22:42): e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af - has geoloc v2 been fixed to not fork so drastically from the vCard4 location/address schema?",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:42): f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905: um, i'm not reviewing that spec today",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:42): at least one of the specs decided to just have a text field",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:43): but really, if you want input, you should send input to the lists",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:43): getting others to proxy for you isn't fair to them :(",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (22:44): fair enough - wasn't attempting a proxy - I find it's useful to get a second opinion on feedback.",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:44): i will look at that other spec at some point",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:44): it's just that today i have a trip to phily",

        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (22:45): np at all - was just an opportunitistic ping - no rush whatsoever",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:45): and it's only 2 days one of which is travel",

        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:45): yeah, i'll definitely review that spec at some point, it's on my todo list",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:45): i might even look at it this month",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (22:45): have a great time, and please don't worry about the spec at all while you're away.",

        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:45): right now i'm moderately more worried about some guy who replied to a part 6 in my public-web-intents series",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:46): afaict he didn't read parts 1..5",

        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:46): the nonsense is people who jump in w/o reading the setup",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:46): which i painstakingly wrote",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (22:46): it's a wrongly framed/named approach, but that's longer discussion we can have after your vacation.",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:46): i even get people to prereview my posts",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:47): naming is a disaster i'll give you",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:47): there are Intents and then there are Intentional Events",

        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (22:47): i'd rather call one &quot;Distributed Actions&quot; and the other &quot;Command Inputs&quot;",
