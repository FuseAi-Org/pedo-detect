        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (19:05): But IANACE",
        "8838d5ec8a97532270c3fa876f22012c (19:05): help me out here.. what's CE stand for :)",

        "8838d5ec8a97532270c3fa876f22012c (19:06): gotcha :D",
        "8838d5ec8a97532270c3fa876f22012c (19:06): I attended a panel at SXSW last week and someone had a presentation at all the inconsistencies",

        "8838d5ec8a97532270c3fa876f22012c (19:07): its even broken for the same browser on different platforms",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (19:07): 8838d5ec8a97532270c3fa876f22012c: I believe they are considered replaced elements from a CSS-theory standpoint",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (19:07): But of course that is not true in practice",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (19:08): (the idea was that users would prefer native-looking widgets on all web pages. This turns out to not quite be true)",
        "8838d5ec8a97532270c3fa876f22012c (19:08): well for example, safari 4 beta applies &quot;width&quot; differently",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (19:16): Alhough I think that probably depends on the definition of &quot;popular&quot;",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:16): I suppose you think influenza is a good design that should be copied too, since it's been wildly successful at becoming widespread",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:17): It _is_ copied all the time :P",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:22): If you're trying to make a virus that kills millions then it may be good to copy the characteristics of existing viruses, and if you're trying to make a new HTML then it may be good to copy the characteristics of HTML, but that's all largely irrelevant if you're trying to make an embeddable vector graphics language or a car or anything else",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:23): e.g. maybe your goal is to let advanced users do useful things as easily as possible, rather than making it possible for everybody in the world to publish their own thoughts",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:24): so it's not particularly helpful to compare it to HTML",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:25): Let's make a compiler that explodes if you make an error",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:30): That would be better than some compilers I use, which explode even when I haven't made an error",
