        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:30): but nevermind, I just saw it =P",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:32): :(",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:40): Pyru:  the table cell holding the Divs is correctly sizing down with the window, and the boxes keeping their auto dimensions properly and bleeding out as they would",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:40): hmm",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:41): Pyru:  so, is all good as far as I can tell, the boxes do come out when the parent box, the TD, changes its percentage driven width with the containing window",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:41): all you can do is prevent the TD from resizing by using a table-layout: fixed; on its parent Table",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:41): well",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:41): not quite",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:41): well yes quite heheehe",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:41): lol",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:42): I don't want it resizing like that",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:42): because then the text moves into more lines",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:42): etc",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:42): using 100% makes the Table width dependent on the parent container's",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:42): so, if you don't want the TD shrinking to a point the child Divs will bleed out, then you do have to provided a fixed minimum",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:43): =/ to a px width?",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:46): table-layout: fixed; works on the Table and then on the 1st TR of, the the 2nd TD give it a fixed figure",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:46): the % unit is what makes the TD shrink",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:49): Pyru:  the Divs do not have a width set, but since they're all in a TD, the longest-word Div will dictate the Div's width, and while the TD shrinks, the Div can't due to lack of white-space to wrap chars :)",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (09:49): in this case is just noticeable, as if it was only text, because is text children of Divs with borders, otherwise you'd just see the longestwords stick out",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:50): alright",
        "fcd5332e6b8824195646aebb2e55053d (09:52): im still confused",
