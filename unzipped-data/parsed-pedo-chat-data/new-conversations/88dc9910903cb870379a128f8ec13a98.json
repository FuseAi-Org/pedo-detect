        "936e36f7a71852e10a649295a6a9729f (16:20): cool, re HTML+RDFa1.1 - would you be happier if there was /no/ mention at all of xmlns in that doc (html host lang for rdfa core)",
        "936e36f7a71852e10a649295a6a9729f (16:20): or, mentioned only for processors for backwards compat with xhtml+rdfa1.0 with a text/html mime type",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:21): 936e36f7a71852e10a649295a6a9729f: I'd be happier if neither RDFa in HTML nor RDFa in XHTML relied on xmlns:foo",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:22): and compat with existing content was achieved by hardwiring property names",

        "936e36f7a71852e10a649295a6a9729f (16:24): ack, moving topic in meeting - will pick up at a later date",

        "936e36f7a71852e10a649295a6a9729f (16:26): we're moving to hard wire them (well for processors) - but doesn't handle all of them, will only handle some",
        "936e36f7a71852e10a649295a6a9729f (16:26): and we have in charter the bc thing, so can't avoid",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:27): 936e36f7a71852e10a649295a6a9729f: charters are set by the people in the WG, so it's not really credible to point to charter as something that forces you",
        "936e36f7a71852e10a649295a6a9729f (16:27): so 50+ mentions in HTML+RDFa1.1 - and 1 in rdfa core :|",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:30): Instead of mentioning &quot;xmlns&quot; explicitly, you could discourage people from using it by calling it &quot;U+0078 LATIN SMALL LETTER X, U+006D LATIN SMALL LETTER M, U+006C LATIN SMALL LETTER L, U+006E LATIN SMALL LETTER N, U+0073 LATIN SMALL LETTER S&quot;",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:42): 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, http://www.w3.org/2006/webapi/track/issues/35",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:42): it seems form submission works by dispatching a synthetic submit event",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:51): I'm leaning towards only initEvent() resetting stuff",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:51): and then making the first argument of initEvent optional too",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (16:52): i think like you suggested, resetting in init*Event makes most sense--prevents the canceled flag from being set and then the cancel flag from being unset (inconsistent state), and avoids both the problems of early-reset and late-reset during dispatch",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:52): yup",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:52): and when we get fancy-objects I guess we should let initEvent take an object",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:52): instead of a series of arguments",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:53): so you can easily set all the properties",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:53): and then &quot;deprecate&quot; init*Event and not allow them on new event objects",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (16:53): the &quot;set the properties manually&quot; idea would be nice but that seems way too different from the current model where most event properties are readonly",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (16:53): http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2011/03/03/wanted-native-js-encryption/",
