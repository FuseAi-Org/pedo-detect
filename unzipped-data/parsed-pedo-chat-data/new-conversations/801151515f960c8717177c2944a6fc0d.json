        "204b37d58cf89b1999cb18a804cc0da6 (23:02): question, once ram goes bad that's pretty much it correct? I had my system go down unexpectedly due to power outages, and shortly after i started getting system crashes and segmentation faults from different applications.... I ran a memtest and ran into several errors within the first 4 minutes....",
        "204b37d58cf89b1999cb18a804cc0da6 (23:02): is there any way to reset the memory or is it pretyt much over for it?",
        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:02): omg, sysfault, exact same happened to me :(",

        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:03): i can't afford a UPS damnit",

        "204b37d58cf89b1999cb18a804cc0da6 (23:05): both are bad im assuming, i ran the test with both of them in.",
        "204b37d58cf89b1999cb18a804cc0da6 (23:05): didn't run it by themselves.",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (23:05): it does the stuff sequentially...",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (23:05): I'd trt both seperatly",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (23:05): one might still be good",

        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (23:05): anyways, if I'm going to spend 2300 euros on a computer, I'll spend 150 euros on a UPS for it",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (23:06): (my reasoning)",
        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:06): SpComb, how much is not expensive?",

        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (23:06): well, $50 will probably get you some 500 VA",
