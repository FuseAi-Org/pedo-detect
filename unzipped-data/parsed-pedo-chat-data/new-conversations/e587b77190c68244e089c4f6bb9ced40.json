        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:31): Hello all. I've been using vim as my daily editor for at least five years now. It works great for most things but my current task seems to challenge my favorite editor. I'm attempting to format a 5000+ line JSP. Now there is definitely an argument to be made that it is bad form to have a JSP this large anyway, but my task wasn't to write it, rather to re-factor and re-write large portions of...",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:31): ...it. I usually start something like this by fixing a lot of formatting to get an understanding of the code... It is simply taking too long though. Most of the tools I've found for this task fall flat. Vim gets the job done, I just have to wonder if there is something I could be doing to make my editing task more efficient with vim. Any suggestions?",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:32): daveman1010: for the case at hand? Most like gg=G",

        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:33): yeah, I'm using a lot of regular expressions...",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:34): yes, but that command will reformat everything &quot;sanely&quot; if you have filetype indent enabled.",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:34): gg=G?",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:34): hmm",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:34): well, it'll re-indent it sanely at least.",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:35): and that's usually a good start.",
        "fa92dbf68a4d779204a8f09d9af0b7ff (19:35): formatting code is the suX0rs",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:35): eKo1: reformatting it is; doing it right the first time isn't.",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:36): Yeah, I think that's the problem... I usually try that first.",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:36): JSP doesn't look so nice with that though.",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:37): mixture of html and code...",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:37): It doesn't seem to want to format both.",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:37): dunno how good the JSP style info is",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:38): It gets worse too. There are CSS and JS in here.",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:38): I've factored that stuff out.",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:38): What is left is mostly html and java.",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:38): in general, I've found doing things with regexes and macros to be the best option. If you don't know how to use macros, now is a VERY good time to learn.",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:38): I use macros a lot.",

        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:38): It is still very tough to get this job done.",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:39): I presumed you knew regex if you've been using vim daily for 5 years :)",

        "fa92dbf68a4d779204a8f09d9af0b7ff (19:39): Automate what you can of course.",

        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:40): if you can easily segment stuff out, save it to separate files, then see if vim can automagically reformat those files. Then re-integrate it.",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:40): Not sure that'll help all that much.",

        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:41): Of course... But 95% of the code you ever work with was written by someone else... :-)",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:42): yah, but at least in my last two jobs it wasn't written by idiots :)",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:42): lol",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:42): having enforced coding standards helps.",
        "32d5b698fc6f05f13057d703bd0cd486 (19:43): noted...",
        "fa92dbf68a4d779204a8f09d9af0b7ff (19:44): yes, coding standards help ALOT",
        "fb2c4f3e688db2a676f292cd15961a59 (19:46): of course, that again presumes that the coding standards aren't written by an idiot that doesn't know WTF he's doing. I'm not sure that would've helped in your predecessor's case.",
