        "fcb899c4a793d582cfe40a9480f90b4e (09:05): from my understanding you have to rebuild the bfu archive with some modified source",
        "fcb899c4a793d582cfe40a9480f90b4e (09:06): or maybe it's already compiled you just have to rebuild the archive or something",

        "fcb899c4a793d582cfe40a9480f90b4e (09:08): so you need a solaris box to build a xen capable image",

        "fcb899c4a793d582cfe40a9480f90b4e (09:14): well.. gnusolaris (nexenta) has the whole debian userland, so i'm guessing?",
        "316982397a0e69355664adb9941f9144 (09:15): evidently the answer is no",

        "fcb899c4a793d582cfe40a9480f90b4e (09:17): i think it is a problem w/ the vmware network drivers but i'm not sure",

        "316982397a0e69355664adb9941f9144 (09:24): it takes about a half hour",
        "316982397a0e69355664adb9941f9144 (09:25): faster if you're using an iso as the cdrom",
