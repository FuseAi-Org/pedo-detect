        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:43): why is e1000 code (and some other NICS) is closed ?",
        "6caff723a014fddb53dff9e10dd9e175 (14:43): prorietary code probably",
        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:43): because on linux, for example, the VERY SAME nic has an open source !",
        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:43): which is maintained by Intel !",
        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:43): so I underatnd that Intel DOES NOT YET",
        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:44): develop code for it's NICs on solaris",
        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:44): but why on earth is this code closed ? I assume SUN",
        "0e60fa2a21b13bc3d41902ac2acd28e3 (14:44): SunnyDay: incorrect assumption to make",
        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:44): is developing this code",

        "0e60fa2a21b13bc3d41902ac2acd28e3 (14:45): SunnyDay: the e1000g is Intel's. Just because they provide an OSS driver for linux does not mean that they are under any obligation whatsoever to do the same for (Open)Solaris",
        "d29f7858616789349f2e17f17eaa3395 (14:45): anyway, both sun and intel have both open and closed software mantained at the same time, I don't see this as a strange thing...",

        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:46): jmcp, of course they are not obliged; but why they are not delivering it ?",

        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:48): I am just curious why is the reason behind this because as I understand, once they deliver code for a NIC under linux, than delivering code for the same NIC for opensoalris cannot BY DEFINITION reveal anything new; am I right in this ?",
        "6caff723a014fddb53dff9e10dd9e175 (14:48): SunnyDay, phone Intel and ask.",

        "12f2c01b9e8d45fbd19e9b2e833940a7 (14:49): for solaris",

        "0e60fa2a21b13bc3d41902ac2acd28e3 (14:51): probably",
