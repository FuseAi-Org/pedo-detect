        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (07:20): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, ok",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:21): thanks",

        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:21): spec things",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:21): elaborate?",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:22): well, for example, opentype doesn't really define font weights very well aside from giving 100-900 names",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:22): there are a bunch of fonts with weights of say 950 or 1000",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:22): (not many with 1000, but a few.  quite a few 950s)",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:23): (and i've seen other x50 ones)",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:24): just trying to understand what the best thing to do is/if the spec should change",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:25): like, if i have a 900 and a 1000, i should probably ignore the 1000 (or use it/support it?) but if i don't have a 900 i should probably round the 950/1000 down",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:26): if i have 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, ... 950 should i support them all? bolder/lighter do what?",

        "5d5b78699e57104f2fa03bbdf7b9197b (07:30): by gsnedders on Tue Dec 18 21:41:19",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:31): imho, supporting more than that is feasable",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:31): like, the spec says &quot;If the font family already uses a numerical scale with nine values (like e.g. OpenType does), the font weights should be mapped directly.&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:32): yeah if you have more than 2 weight above bold (700) then the spec just says to drop some",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:32): except that OpenType doesn't specify just 9 steps",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:32): well, 9 weight is probably enough for now -- most pages don't bother with more than 2 levels anyway",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:32): yeah",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:33): 1000 is pretty rare",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:33): if there really are fonts that have more weights, i would invent keywords -moz-1000, -moz-1100, etc",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:33): think i've seen 2 fonts with it?",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:33): 950 is pretty common thouhg",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:33): so i would say map the boldest one to 900",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:33): map the main bold one to 700",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:33): and if there are any between those to, map the middle one of those to 800",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:34): which direction would you map x50s to if you don't have an exact number for it?",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:34): like, say you have 100, 250, 400",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:35): maybe you map both 200 and 300 to that",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:35): if you have 100, 200, 350, 400, i guess you could round 350 down",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:36): and if you have 100, 200, 300, 350, 400, just skip 350?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:36): map the main medium weight to 400",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:36): map the lightest one to 100",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:37): i'm saying if i have 5 opentype fonts of the same family that have all 5 of those weights",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:37): or 3 or 4 of them",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:37): then just drop one",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:37): what should I do with x50 weights?",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:37): what i suggested?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:38): so, map the main medium weight to 400, the lightest one to 100, and for 200 and 300 just pick some that are equidistant from lightest to medium",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:38): soif you just have one extra, just drop one of them, doesn't matter which",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:38): i wouldn't map the opentype numbers straight to the 100-900 numbers like the spec says, if you have any x50 weights",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:39): well, there is no other concept of &quot;main medium weight&quot; face",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:39): you either have 400 or you don't",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:40): many bold faces if you treat them as a family only have a 700 weight",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:40): i'd just sort them per weight, pin 100, 400 (the &quot;regular&quot; weight), 700 (&quot;bold&quot;), and 900, and fill the others in a linear way so that they are distributed uniformly",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:40): k",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:40): well if you have fewer weights, the spec defines how you fill things in",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:40): right",
        "a6b80daf336e58aacd97cfab4d064aba (07:40): fewer isn't the problem as much",
