        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (21:55): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, s/emtpy/empty/",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (21:56): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, maybe the definition of the 'not' keyword should also say that it changes true queries to become false?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (21:56): (I'm just reading the spec through.)",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (21:56): I guess it says that later, though, so never mind.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (21:59): you did use this spec when implementing right?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (21:59): yes",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (21:59): ok",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (21:59): but I commented on it a number of times while doing that",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (21:59): But I assume you saw those comments...",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (21:59): yeah, those issues should've been addressed by now",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:05): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, what about http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Apr/0051.html ?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:09): that behavior would change, but &quot;unknown, screen&quot; would not",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:09): I prefer going back",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:09): how would you serialize in the CSSOM?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:10): partly because it's nice for implementations to only need to keep a list of the types they support",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:10): rather than keeping a list of all types",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:10): which is more generally how CSS error handling works",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:10): I'd serialize by just spitting the name back out; we store it as a string anyway.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:10): (atomized)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:10): it also seems weird to drop 'not unknown and (x)' and not drop 'not unknown'",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:11): that's actually the main reason",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:11): not if you think of 'screen' as equivalent to '(type: &quot;screen&quot;)'",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:12): my bigger concern is that I'd really rather not have to put a list of *all* media types in the code",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:12): because that's going to need maintainence over time as specs add media types",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:12): or change the name of the aural/speech/whatever media type",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:12): etc.",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:12): I'd rather just have to know which media types we support",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:12): just like I only know which media features we support",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:12): or like we only know which properties we support",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:12): why'd you need to include media types you don't support?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (22:13): hi",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:13): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, because the spec currently says we have to apply a style sheet with &quot;not embossed&quot; and NOT apply a stylesheet with &quot;not nonexistent&quot;",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:13): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, so we'd have to keep a list of all the types we don't support",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:14): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, that doesn't fit with other CSS error handling (properties we don't support, etc.)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:14): I see",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:14): Right now, that's a list of 10 or so types... although it seems to be different in every spec, and it could grow significantly in the  future...",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:15): I guess I'd prefer &quot;not embossed&quot; to not work either if the implementation doesn't do embossed",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:15): that seems even weirder",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:15): I guess",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:15): so if we suddenly add projection style sheet support, we'll suddenly start applying &quot;not projection&quot; sheets to screen media, where we didn't before?",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:15): (Remember, the point of the error handling rules is largely about extensibility.)",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (22:16): anyway, lunchtime",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:17): you can make the same argument for starting to support (x) in the expression 'not screen and (x)'",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (22:18): anyway, I should probably go home"
