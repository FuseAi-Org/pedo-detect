        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:05): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, there is no base URL concept in HTML5 that I can use here?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:06): 2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de: as far as i can tell, the behavior you are describing is not one that anything in html5 has",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:06): I wonder how to make it work in such a way that it will also work in Web Workers",

        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:11): the problem is that currently it is wrong",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:11): because currently it only has a base URL once constructed",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:11): it needs to change so that the interface object has an associated base URL",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:14): e.g. in case the interface object gets copied across Windows before any object creation takes place",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:41): well html5's timetable has been pretty well established for several years now, you should have expected changes :-)",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:41): also, implementors are not really helping that much  62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fcart from when 62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc was still reviewing) so it's hard to figure out how much is still to be done",

        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:42): for XHR 2 it depends on when the File Upload stuff gets done",
