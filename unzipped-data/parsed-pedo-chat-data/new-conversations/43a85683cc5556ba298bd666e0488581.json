        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:39): I'll sum it up for you: Linux has technical reasons for not having a stable API. Any other operating system that does not have a stable API has stagnated.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:40): and yes, that is a 100% accurate paraphrasing.",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:40): delewis: Please, puh-lease tell me that this argument didn't come from the same person who I distinctly remember telling me that OS development is over and that all OSes are feature-complete.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:40): LeftWing: no, actually, he stayed out of it most of the time.",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:40): Good for him.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:41): though, he did say that one of the &quot;good things&quot; about Linux is that its not chained to any one, specific implementation of anything.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:41): (positively, speaking)",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:41): Uuhhhh. :P",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:41): It's chained to one specific implementation of ALSA. =P",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:43): Someone should explain to them the principle of &quot;Measure Twice, Cut Once.&quot;  You shouldn't need to keep changing an API, purely because you didn't think about it clearly enough the first time around.",

        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:51): Perhaps it's a sound technical decision for an alpha-grade product that isn't yet released, but it certainly isn't one from the point of view of the poor sods that have to use and develop for the system.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:52): LeftWing: you're forgetting that the majority of people in that channel don't use Linux for anything meaningful (well, they would disagree).",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:52): Oh, and the other thing that irks me is the argument that discouraging proprietary drivers in this way will eventually cause companies like nvidia to cave and release opensource drivers.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:52): they don't understand that when you roll an operating system out into the &quot;real world&quot;, there is no second chance to learn from.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:52): you do it right the first time around or you fuck up, like Microshit.",

        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:53): of course Nvidia isn't going to protest.",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:55): One day they'll realise that consumers want drivers from manufacturers of cards to be embraced.  Or, alternately, they'll remain in many respects a hobbyist technical utopia.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:55): they also are unable to distinguish &quot;free&quot; from &quot;proprietary&quot;",

        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:56): even if Nvidia did provide specifications and at the same time, provided a binary-only driver, they still wouldn't be satisifed.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:57): regardless",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (10:57): reading that log the second time around gave me a chuckle. :-)",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (10:58): Actually I think if specs were provided, they'd just latch on permanently to whatever the open-source driver writers came up with as a result, and trumpet (regardless of reality) the fact that it was a superior driver.",

        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (11:01): no one really cares about systems development anymore",

        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (11:02): very interesting operating system, but do any of the Linux people (who are supposedly proclaimed computer scientists) care about it? no.",

        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (11:02): Support from vendors and a client base is somewhat important, too. ;P",

Later someone pastes the url for kroah's keynote speech, since he's the guy the wrote the api_nonsense doc, where it says the linux USB stack has been rewritten at least 3 times.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (11:28): IvanR_: exactly, but they're against backwards compatibility. &quot;If it sucks, dump it&quot;.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (11:29): so, rewriting an API 3 times isn't a big deal because its &quot;quality control&quot;, on the other hand maintaining 3 APIs for the sake of compatibility is bad.",
