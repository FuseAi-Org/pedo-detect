        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:18): +hey guys, i have a silly question",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:19): +hi",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:19): +lets say you had a 24 port switch (no VLANS setup) but you had two different networks on that switch 192.168.1.x 172.16.x.x",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:19): +has the switch works on layer 2",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:19): +it would know all the mac adresses of devices attached",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:20): +i gues so...",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:20): +as a switch it hould work for the 2 networks...",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:20): +so if you sent a ping... from one node to another (on the other network) it would ping.... as the switch would look at layer 2 frame get the dest mac and forward to relevant port",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:21): +from the 192 to the 172 network you mean... ?",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:21): +yep",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:21): +then you need routing from x to y",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:21): +as switch wouldnt care about the layer 3 addressing",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:21): +it would look at layer 2 find mac address and check it arp table forward to relevant port",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:21): +who is the default gw. ?",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:21): +that dont matter...",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:21): +think about it....",
        "23538b2424b6c3deaf2c10fc2dcfd34f (16:21): +I have bcmsn-like test tomorrow, netacad test from chapter 1 to 8.",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:22): +switch looks at layer 2 (frame)",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:22): +I'm no expert.. but I think that won't work..",

        "00f39836d182ebb443457e1c0a8aaf65 (16:22): -hola",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:22): +you reallu need routing to go from network x to y",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:22): +ldexter why not ? the switch would look at layer 2 frame and not layer 3 packet?",
        "00f39836d182ebb443457e1c0a8aaf65 (16:23): -What happens is, you ping 172.x.x.x, since the network is not directly connected, you'll need a route to that network",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:23): +yep",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:23): +it is directly connected via switch",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:23): +ok...",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:23): +think this way...",
        "00f39836d182ebb443457e1c0a8aaf65 (16:23): -The local machine that you're pinging from doesn't know anything about 172.. Its not directly conencted and it doesn't have a route, it'll think you're crazy.",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:23): +no need.. the host that you ping from will try to contact your default gw",

        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:24): +ldexter ok :)",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (16:24): +but why switch not forward if it know the dest mac address is in it table ?",
        "31f0cd5776fda31893bae4a109bcde93 (16:24): +you can add an alias in the 172 network on the host in the 192 network....",
        "00f39836d182ebb443457e1c0a8aaf65 (16:24): -Its not that the switch won't forward, the host machine that you're pinging from won't even send anything to the switch",
        "00f39836d182ebb443457e1c0a8aaf65 (16:24): -It has no need to",
