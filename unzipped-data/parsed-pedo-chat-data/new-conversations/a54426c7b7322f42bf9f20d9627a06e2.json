        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:50): but when i get back home i'll send mail about it",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:50): heh",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:51): thanks",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:51): waits for recompile",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:53): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: it's not so much the timing of the late-breaking changes that makes me sad as that they're going to make it very, very, very hard for anything like the original circumstances where postMessage got approval to land so late to ever happen again",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:53): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: I think if people had known the two sets of changes were going to happen after that, they'd have said no",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:53): heck, *I* might even have said no",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:54): 8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33: I probably would have said yes to the postMessage work before Safari 3.1 even if I had known it would be followed by changes, because I think that level of engagement was part of what led to the changes",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:54): (and I think the changes that made us pull it were for the better)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:55): I do understand that implementing features against an unstable spec, especially late in a dev cycle, can be disruptive",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:55): I had the work all done for several months; it just wasn't in the tree because we were &quot;past&quot; feature freeze",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:55): I don't mind the implementation",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:55): 8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33: If the feature wasn't approved for FF3, how long would it be before it could be in a release?",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:55): I don't know",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:55): that's the other half of the matter",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:55): as I understand it .next is supposed to be a quick turnaround, but I don't know how quick",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:56): Is .next different from Mozilla 2?",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:56): I *think* so",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:56): Mozilla 2 has never sounded particularly likely for quick turnaround to me",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:56): a 3.5, so to speak, with a few cherry-picked things",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:56): for Safari/WebKit I am expecting gaps of less than a year between releases with new engine features for the foreseeable future",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:56): The whole &quot;let's (automatically) rewrite all our code and change all our APIs&quot; thing makes me a little nervous",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:56): if it's not different from 2, then it's not a quick turnaround",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:57): the change APIs thing is more, &quot;we'll change where we've needed to change&quot;",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (02:57): Mozilla 2 work is being scoped back beyond the vague &quot;rewrite everything&quot; plans from 2 years ago",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:57): wonders if he might get canvas shadows into 3.5 :-)",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:57): but yeah, I'm still not clear on exactly how everything's panning out",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (02:57): and, that's expected, really",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (02:57): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: almost certainly",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:58): reasonably self-contained feature-size things are generally what's in the plans",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:58): Hmm, I did the shadow thing six months ago - I didn't realise it was that long :-/",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:59): (and apparently it was feature freeze back then)",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:59): so the 100K patch that adds stuff and doesn't have twisty interactions but is just too late to trust, is the prototypical &quot;take&quot;",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (02:59): but no fundamental reworkings of anything",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:59): That sounds quite sensible",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:22): Hooray, I used the scientific method today",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:23): There were about a hundred small flying insects sitting on the ceiling by the light above my bed this evening, so I hypothesised that they were attracted by lights",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:24): so I turned that light off and pointed a desk lamp at a wall as far away as possible (about two metres) from my bed, and after several hours they've nearly all migrated to that wall",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:24): so I think I'll consider my hypothesis to be true",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:24): Also it means I can go to bed without being scared of insects dropping onto my head",
        "fe70b49783daa65bcb249805fb3a2b24 (03:25): you can consider your hypothesis not falsified by your experiment",
        "fe70b49783daa65bcb249805fb3a2b24 (03:25): (if you wanna be hardcore scientific method)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:25): I don't want to be that hardcore - I like to be able to believe that at least some things in this world are true, and aren't merely not known to be false :-)"
