        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (18:56): Some might argue that blender has faster modelling toolls, and that may be so, but when it comes to getting a FINISHED PRODUCT, in my experience max has always been much faster than blender at that, namely because of the automation support",

        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:02): BeBraw: I'm doubting that.",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:04): the ultimate solution would be to build a drag and drop ui editor but that's too easy for the user and too hard for the coder",
        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:04): My lib isn't terribly hard to use.",
        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:04): And the great thing about it, the GUI objects are static. They stick around.",

        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:04): You don't have to reinitialize them on every draw() pass...I set it up so that each object simply has a draw() method through which the draw loop passes.",
