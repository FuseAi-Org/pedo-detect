        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (15:45): looking at slashdot. just think of the area that says &quot;IT: Phishers Defeat Citibank's 2-Factor Authentication&quot; as one div block. if you click on that text, the website takes you to another page which shows you the same thing: topic and the context of the topic. do you think they are using includes for that?",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (15:46): just that the color scheme is different",
        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (15:50): krz: I think they are using a database for that.",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (15:51): i know that. but for the layout of that div block",
        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (15:53): css?",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (15:54): yes, but you would still have something like &lt;div class=&quot;header&quot;&gt; etc",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (15:54): in your html file",
        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (15:55): then no, i dont think they use include files for that, i think they simply have a style guide for elements and classes that they follow.",
        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (15:56): but afaik, slashdot runs slashcode, an open source cms, so you can find out the truth.",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (15:57): my website has div blocks that are used in several pages",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (15:57): and im not talking about headers and footers",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (15:57): im wondering if i should use includes, rather than to specify the div block on each web page",
        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (15:58): i always pick class names and elements after semantic meaning, and avoid names that indicate style. so i have no problem duplicating it.",
        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (15:59): if you have massive amounts of redundant elements just to accomplish some silly styling, then tearing it out to reusable parts might be a good idea.",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (16:00): the real problem is when i find myself editing the div block on one page, i have to do the same editing of the div block on other pages",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (16:00): thats why im considering using an include",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (16:01): it has nothing to do with naming convention",
        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (16:01): why do you have that problem?",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (16:02): because the div block is defined on every web page",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (16:02): just immagine if you had to define the header on every web page and then decide to change it",
        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (16:05): well, it seems like you should be writing a reusable component to refer to then.",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (16:06): noss yea, it can actually be described as a component. but on a website",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (16:06): noss so what do you suggest?",
        "30f78cd500afd51e75d8351e4418ed9a (16:06): use of includes?",

        "9621eb291fb98ba098685ed872b8cf9a (16:50): which means you're probably using tables inappropriately",

        "a356ab67ed5f22602d4f3c3df1042ef9 (17:16): what you need to do is to give each submit button a unique name. you cant give them the same name and differentiate the action depending on the value of this name",
