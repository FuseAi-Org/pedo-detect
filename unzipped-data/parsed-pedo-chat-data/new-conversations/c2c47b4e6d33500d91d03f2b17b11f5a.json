        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (18:44): I was wondering, is there any form of webcam streaming possible with HTML5 so far?",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:46): 65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56, it has &lt;video&gt; tag",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:46): actually i have no idea about streaming video support, all examples i have seen have used static files",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:47): hm, you mean &quot;any form&quot;? i guess you could also use series of images, updated by javascript or something",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (18:48): Well, it needs to be live",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (18:48): I guess that will still be the good old flash then.",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:49): you should look into streaming video support of &lt;video&gt; tag",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (18:49): Where exactly can I find the best reference on this?",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:52): google for it",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:52): 65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56, https://labs.ericsson.com/developer-community/blog/beyond-html5-conversational-voice-and-video-implemented-webkit-gtk",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:53): that might be interesting",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:53): also, i think there is a big difference whether webcam is local or remote",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (18:53): I am creating a social website, and I would like to add webcam conversations",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (18:54): then that might be just the right thing you need",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (18:54): Thank you for the link btw :)",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (18:57): Not very relevant, but there aren't any web developers who have some spare time left and would like to contribute to my project, correct?",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:02): you gotta look around, i'm sure some would be interested",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:03): I managed to get 1 person in my team. Others just mentioned how stupid I was asking for volunteers",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:03): i'm having too much work at the moment and i'm just beginner in html5/javascript programming",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:03): that's not stupid",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:04): I'm not very experienced myself, that's why I need a team",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:07): whats the project?",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:07): It's a web application about meeting new people. The core idea can be compared to sites like Omegle, though my concept is a very advanced version of such services",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:07): what comes to html5 features, i doubt there are lot of people with experience, html5 has envolved rapidly in last year and is rather new tech",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:07): Well, I was just mentioning it here since HTML5 regards web development after all",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:07): I dunno about that, it doesn't take long to become an expert in html5",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:07): this would be nice opportunity to gain some html5 experience",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:07): I guess it might be better to use flash for webcams at the moment",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:08): Forcing people to upgrade their browsing results in a huge lost in users",

        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:08): I think very recently google opened up their video chat technology",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:08): Where? :O",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:08): google wave?",

        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:09): i think that was using old tech, not html5",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:09): yea I dunno",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:09): prolly old tech tho yea",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:09): btw, have you though how to solve bandwidth problem",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:09): like, it would require websockets which haven't been finalized yet",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:09): p2p",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:10): I was hoping the founder of Omegle would be a nice guy and would love to brainstorm about my project, but he appears to be a douche",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:10): will that work with mobile devices?",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:10): Not sure",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:10): But I am targetting desktop browsers first",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:10): I don't think webcam chat is such a smart idea for mobile devices",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:11): i hope newer mobile devices have better connectivity than old j2me-based phones",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:11): i think that was not even tcp, instead some weird stuff on top of gsm",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:11): The only issue at the moment is finding a name for my project so development can start! D:",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:11): video chat from mobile devices is about to become mainstream",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:12): you can use name generators :)",
        "65eb7bf43c7852a8955c7659151c0b56 (19:12): HTML6 needs something like &lt;generatebusinessname&gt; lol",

        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:12): eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf, i would argue",

        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:13): it'll be a basic requirement of phones and people will use it. I'm not saying it'll be used the majority of the time",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:13): its like 3D tvs",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:13): you dont use 3d all the time, just when you want",

        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:13): i think there have been numerous attempts since 60's to bring video chat into mainstream but it does not catch up because of social reasons, not technical reasons",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:13): yea thats the thing",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:14): people like invisibility",

        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:14): but its going to become mainstream in the sense that everyone can and will use it, but not all the time",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (19:14): you mean i won't get to make phone calls like on star trek with the huge screen?",

        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (19:14): i think people just secretly like to answer the phone nude",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:15): uh, how many times have you got phone call in the middle of special activities",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (19:16): we're developers, we get those times?",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (19:16): or is that just me?",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (19:18): well anyway, there are many social reasons why not to use video chat",
        "eb9491881729b0e53b64c441b797dbdf (19:18): there are just as many social reasons to use it",
