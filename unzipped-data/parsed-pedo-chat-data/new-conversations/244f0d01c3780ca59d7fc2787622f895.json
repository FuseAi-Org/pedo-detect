        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (21:41): In unrelated news, today's xkcd is cool",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (21:42): It is!",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (21:48): Sufficient information to write a test using it.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (21:48): Hmm, the documentation is not great",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (21:49): I can fix that now I guess",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (21:49): That'd be cool.  Pilgrim is asking me about it, and apparently doesn't want to start irc on his mac.",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (22:07): IE9 will be shipping with the HTML5 parser, right? While I'm asking, have either Safari or Chrome shipped the parser yet?",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (22:20): and the WebKit HTML5 parser has not shipped in normal Safari or Chrome yet, afaik",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (22:20): I think it's in the current Chrome betas though",

        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (22:41): Saw the discussion on www-archive re libxml2...",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (22:41): I think the key is to get libxml2 to pass the same tests as Henri's parser does",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (22:41): oh, if the libxml2 guys want to impl the html5 parsing algorithm, i'm all for it",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (22:41): that would be awesome",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (22:42): that's the key IF.  Any evidence that that is the case?",

        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (22:44): this thread came out of the nodejs list, on which I was advocating using Aria's JS impl of the HTML5 parser and not the libxml2 HTML parser",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (22:48): My guess is that Aria is more compliant but libxml2 is much faster.",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (22:48): quick scan, and I see a thread from 2008 about libxml2 implementing html5 that seems to have died...",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (22:50): *nod*. for my needs, correct trumps fast as I'm using the parser in the publication workflow of what ends up being a pile of static assets served by apache",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (22:50): scales nicely :)",

        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (23:01): hsivonen's has code that converts his java parser into C and then includes that into firefox; the problem is that that code presumes that you have mozilla's runtime library",
        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (23:02): right",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (23:02): I think the right thing to do is to pelt the libxml2 guys with bug reports :-P",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (23:02): Anybody remember where the test suite is for html5lib?  (I used to know...)",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (23:04): I would doubt that the libxml2 HTML parser would ever pass the html5lib tests without pretty much being rewritten",
