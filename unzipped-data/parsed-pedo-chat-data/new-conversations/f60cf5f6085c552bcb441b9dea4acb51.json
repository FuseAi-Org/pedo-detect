        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:08): if i set event handler, then the handler function's 'this' will refer to event caller?",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (00:08): 7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8: two of them hang here usually",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (00:08): i see one of them now",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:11): 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049: I talked to anton as he had to leave, so I just sent him an email :-), thank you anyways!",

        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:12): no",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:12): if so, whithin the handler this will be the same as event.target",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:13): (this might be specific to jQuery)",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:13): i have rather specific problem, but not related to jQuery, just plain javascript",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:13): 30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2: have you tryed to console.log the this to see its value?",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:14): sec, i already asked in #javascript some time ago",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:15): MyClass.prototype.f = function() {}; MyClass.prototype.g = function() { Something.onload = function() { &quot;call f&quot; }; }; &lt;- how to refer to function f inside function h?",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:16): i cannot use 'this' in the callback",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:16): since it refers to something's context",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:17): You can us .bind, but you'll need a shim for older browsers",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:17): in java you have similar problem with anonymous inner classes, but you can refer to outer instance using OuterClassName.this",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:18): right, you can do the same InstanceOfMyClass.f() --&gt; this = InstanceOfMyClass",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:18): i tried to use MyClass.prototype.f() but it seems to refer to something else than original instance",

        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:19): Are you creating a instance class or static?",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:20): hm, i instance class?",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:20): then instead of calling it using MyClass.prototype.f() you should use the instatiated object's f function, not the prototypes",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:22): hm, i have no idea about that, sec, i try to paste some code",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:22): use jsfiddle to show what you're doing",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:23): http://pastebin.com/D7VqhZHK",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:24): hm, it's plain old javascript, no libraries or anything",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:24): lines 25 and 30 are problematic",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:26): within the search method you can create a variable referencing this, eg: var that = this;",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:27): then within the onload function you can call the addEntry within the right context with that.addEntry(...);",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:27): hm, thought there was another way",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:28): anyway, thanks, seems like it's the only solution",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:28): That is how I normaly do it, if there is a better way, I would like to know :-)",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:30): also, i got eclipse javascript support working, came out i had to enable it manually for the project",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:31): anyway, it asks me to place lot of semicolons",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:31): check your javascript code with JSHint",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:37): hm it outputs lot of errors",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:37): Better start fixing :-)",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:41): ok, two errors are left",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:41): &quot;Use the function form of &quot;use strict&quot;.&quot; &lt;- doesn't function form prevent me accessing my classes outside the script?",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:43): http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:43): so basically i need to wrap my script around large anonymous function?",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:43): pretty much yeah",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:43): inside*",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:44): it's a good practice, if you look at the source code for most popular 3rd party js code, you'll see that they all do it",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:44): (function (window, undefined) { ...you script here... }) (window);",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:48): hm, my script parts on the .html cannot anymore accept classes from the script file",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:49): if i do not use any 3rd party libs and do not write a lib, i think it should be safe to leave out the function wrapper",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:49): use a global common namespace",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (00:50): hm, how would i assign my class to it?",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:51): Just like you would normally",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:53): you should probably google around a little bit about how to use namespaces and good practices around javascript",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:53): it will answer these questions",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (00:54): http://na.isobar.com/standards/ this is a good place to start",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (01:09): nice, i wrote my code using module concepts",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (01:10): also eclipse recognizes it",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (01:10): anyway, some parts of code are rather verbose: media.ResultsArea.prototype.clear = function() {",
        "30713a44e8df7587c64b4dfd1c09d9d2 (01:11): media is the module name, is it possible to make such definitions shorter?",
        "7a205621b91e4878465075e964d2b1e8 (01:13): I don't think so",

        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (01:14): appears to be same as the html2canvas approach",

        "5b9cb20d2f71fee5f77d39d8e5b3129c (01:14): this seems exactly like html2canvas",
        "5b9cb20d2f71fee5f77d39d8e5b3129c (01:15): html2canvas takes the DOM and then, given the precomputed properties available from the DOM, draws an image to a canvas",
        "5b9cb20d2f71fee5f77d39d8e5b3129c (01:15): kinda reinventing the wheel",

        "5b9cb20d2f71fee5f77d39d8e5b3129c (01:16): and oddly it creates it's own NodeWalker O_o",
