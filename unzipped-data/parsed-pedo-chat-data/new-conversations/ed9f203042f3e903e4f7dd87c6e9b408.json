        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:48): I was changing out how I do memory writing from the emulated CPU core in the gameboy emu",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:48): Apparently doing a more direct write that doesn't require a proxy function fucks up google chrome badly",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:49): while firefox 4 makes no diff, actually a 1% CPU perf win",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:49): seems chrome fails to JIT func in array access when done directly",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:50): rather than using a catch-all func that does it for all the instances",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:50): where the catch all basically takes the address and data and then accesses the array[address](this, address, data)",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:51): inlining essentially is a 2x loss in perf in V8.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:51): when it shouldn't.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:52): probably due to V8 inlining the functions the array accesses, then realizing these are invalid...",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:52): i.e. too optimistic JIT",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:53): since the CPU load varies with the indice patterns, this must hold true",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:54): with the JIT cache going full retard in V8.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:56): paul_irish: Opera's JS engine is the opposite",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:56): way faster now",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:56): now opera wins over firefox and chrome when audio is off and there's no canvas scaling",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:57): Peter`: V8 has a lot of these WTF deoptimization bugs apparently.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:58): hence why these narrow and selective benchmarks are moot.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:58): V8 benchmark &amp; sunspider, meh",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (08:59): of course you're going to be the fastest at something you optimized around.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:06): paul_irish: Google Chrome is officially back on my &quot;slow as fuck&quot; list. :(",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:09): paul_irish: I'm not going to revert my inlining, because that's just silly and it improves perf in pretty much every other browser.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:10): because technically a general JIT would actually improve from less popping and pushing of the stack.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:10): for removing the proxy call",

        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:14): like 20% cpu usage increase",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:14): not to mention chrome still can't do 60 fps with putImageData and web audio is currently broken in chrome.",

        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:22): It's officially slightly slower than IE9",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:22): and slower than Opera, Safari, and Firefox",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:24): heh, chrome also adds 10% CPU load for the real time clock it seems",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (09:24): even though it has a sample rate of 17 there",
