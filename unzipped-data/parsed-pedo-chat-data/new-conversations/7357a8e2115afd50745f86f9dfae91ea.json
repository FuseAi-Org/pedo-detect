        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (21:26): it happens often, but usually in internal bug reports",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (21:30): so importNode and cloneNode are pretty much identical",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:37): the whole http layer should just be one spec",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (21:39): seems like just publishing rfcs in a format other than fixed-width 80-column with hard page breaks as if people still print on 66-line printers is a hard enough battle",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (21:39): They have HTML versions, which are significantly less horrible.",
