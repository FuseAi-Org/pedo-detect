        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:33): Or rather either since I don't intend to do both",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (14:38): is it just me or does the ES5 spec not document deletability/replacability of standard properties?",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:42): oh, yeah, one of them does actually. Was just hard to find",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:46): realises that finding an apartment in the right area is hard for someone who knows absolutely nothing about US geography.",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:47): yeah, 12 month lease is normal",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:50): in Australia, leases are generally either 6 or 12 months",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:50): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I'm not sure it is actually illegal. It's more that contracts aren't usually (legally?) for fixed periods but are continuous. And it is rather hard for landlords to kick you out unless you don't pay the rent",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:51): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, are there minimum lease terms imposed?",

        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (15:52): rather than a maximum",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:52): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I think the only requirement in our contract is that we give 3 months notice if we want to leave",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:52): So that is a kind of minimum",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:53): wow, 3 months is an absurdly long notice period",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (15:53): yeah",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:53): Yeah, it is pretty long",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:53): but I think that's like Norway",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (15:53): when i wasn't in a lease, i only had to give 2 weeks notice",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:54): in Australia, the term means that neither the tennant or landlord can break the lease before that period, and then after that it continues with a requirement for 2 weeks notice",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:54): It seems to be the Swedish way. The landlord has no right to get rid of you (wwhich is good) but it is rather hard to leave (which is bad)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:55): (except when the tennant does something like significantly damages the property, then the landlord can evict the tennant before the end of the lease and keep the bond)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:56): 47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8, is it usually a 1 month bond as well?",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (15:56): yeah",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:56): ok",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (15:56): i may have had a bit more",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:56): (We didn't have to pay any deposit or anything either)",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (15:56): due to my complete absence of a credit history",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:57): I should check if Opera will be providing me with temporary accommodation so I can look for an apartment when I get there",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:57): I'd rather not have to rent something before I get a chance to actually go over there and see the place",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:57): (and the landlady seems to be part of some collective which negotiates the rent with the tennants association and then assigns the right rent to each apartment based on size, facilities, condition, etc.)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:58): (at least that's how I understand it)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:58): I like the deal I get in Norway by staying in one of Opera's apartments :-)",
        "058f354e300cae2f9755165ed8d5131c (15:58): in France, you have to give a 3 months notice before leaving but you can arrange with the owner if you find someone to replace you"
