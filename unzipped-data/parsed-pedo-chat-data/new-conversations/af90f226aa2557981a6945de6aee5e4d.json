        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:09): but that event isn't w3c right ?",

        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:09): onload is standard only in body and iframe",

        "8462e46bc281be6b36940ecbc0823fc5 (06:17): ok I've learned just enough about ajax over the past few days to be dangerous, but not useful",
        "8462e46bc281be6b36940ecbc0823fc5 (06:18): I've got a javascript that submits a form to another site, writes the other site's response into an iframe, and then gives an alert to say it worked",

        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:20): with some tricky code",
        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:20): there are some libraries",
        "8462e46bc281be6b36940ecbc0823fc5 (06:20): do I have to do document.writeln in the current window?",
        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:20): that allow u to make ajax cross domain requests",

        "8462e46bc281be6b36940ecbc0823fc5 (06:20): Is it a security risk?",
        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:21): well .. u have it specified in the own library the pros and cons",

        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:21): u have to analyse it",
        "3c26b6648764f1ab4360aa71da5d760b (06:21): LOL .. anything that tries to hack around it is destined to break fairly soon",

        "8462e46bc281be6b36940ecbc0823fc5 (06:23): well mostly I would like to get rid of the stupid alert, and write the success message somewhere in the current page",
        "8462e46bc281be6b36940ecbc0823fc5 (06:23): or not have any success message, but increment the values in the 'cart_totals' divs",
        "8462e46bc281be6b36940ecbc0823fc5 (06:23): but can I modify their innerHTML without ajax?",
        "8462e46bc281be6b36940ecbc0823fc5 (06:24): I don't really actually need any info from their site, that is the thing",

        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:28): it just imitates the syntax of an ajax request implementation",
        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:28): but what is does",
        "9120874bdd7b85ba45d69d7728790069 (06:29): it to send the data to a serverside php script",
