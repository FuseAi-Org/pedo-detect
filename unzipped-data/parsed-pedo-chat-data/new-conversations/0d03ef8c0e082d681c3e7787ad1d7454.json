        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:44): If you set e.g. red=0.99, what the arc() call is doing is taking the point at 'offset' on the second, and then the point that's 0.99 of the way around the circle in a clockwise direction",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:45): and then you're drawing the arc between those two points in an *anti*-clockwise direction",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:45): so it only fill 0.01 of the circle",
        "bca076755d089d41c07ce1af9b11025c (17:46): So basically it switches the start and end points?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:46): What you probably want is for the second point to be 0.99 around anticlockwise instead, so you'd have to use offset-Math.PI*2*red instead of Math.PI*2*red+offset",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:47): (Uh, &quot;'offset' on the second&quot;? I think I meant &quot;'offset' on the circle&quot;)",

        "bca076755d089d41c07ce1af9b11025c (17:47): I want it to start at the bottom, like it does now.",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:49): Try entering -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, ... in the 'red' input box and I think it gives the appearance you probably want",
