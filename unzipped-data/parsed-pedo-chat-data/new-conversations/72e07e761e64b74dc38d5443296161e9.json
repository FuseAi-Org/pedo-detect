        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:22): main2, honestly I would just scoure the net for tutorials.",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:23): depending on how deep you want to learn and how much you like being frustrated and figuring things out on your own",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:23): sprink, it's called FormBorderStyle or something like that",

        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:25): I might just port bsdiff, but it's a nightmare of bad C syntax and deprecated IO",

        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:25): my conversion rate will probably be like four lines per day :P",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:25): Emon: if a utility can diff and patch binaries, it should theoretically work for any binary, even C# ones",

        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:29): the guy who wrote it describes an algorithm in his thesis that produces patches even 20% smaller than THAT, but I'm betting my head would implode if I tried to comprehend the math",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:29): rofl",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:29): just zip the patches, they should contain pretty redundant data",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:29): lol, yah",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:30): heh",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:30): hell, make them XML based, they'll still zip down to the same amount",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:30): serisously... compress it lol",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:30): oh gawd lol",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:30): I considered that",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:30): that would just mean another person is using XML just because it's there",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:30): nah",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:30): on the other hand it might be fun to port bsdiff since it would be significantly better",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (02:30): GoatCheez: sounds like SOAP to me",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:30): it'd mean they could be easily read by other programs",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:30): er, not xml, I mean just a simple diff + zip or something",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:30): lol",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (02:30): AnarkiNet: yeah, and it'd be fundamentally stupid",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (02:31): what the hell do you do with the packet? a large sequence of writes?",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:31): yeah, use XML for your diffs, because we all know that all diffs are stored in an xml format lol",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:31): haha yeah",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:31): kog, what?",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:31): each byte would be an attribute",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:31): in its own element",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:31): no",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:31): it'd be hexencoded",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:31): what",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (02:31): where's the fun if your patches aren't 500 times the size they should be",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:32): why not MIME encode the binary files,",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:32): lol",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:32): even if they were 500 times bigger, XML is so extrordinarily redundant that it'll still compress down a huge amount",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:32): infact",
        "405830ce0e351e7acb00317f406b772f (02:32): dude",
        "11fcd5cb44b5fee3cc0ae7f2d1a6a238 (02:32): if you use something like WinRK or PAQAR you can get like 95%+ text compression",
        "06d9f5004faf7205aca782823f1c53be (02:32): yes, but the XML would still be totally useless",
        "405830ce0e351e7acb00317f406b772f (02:32): i don't think you're allowed to say bad things about xml",

        "405830ce0e351e7acb00317f406b772f (02:32): what if your boss hears?",
