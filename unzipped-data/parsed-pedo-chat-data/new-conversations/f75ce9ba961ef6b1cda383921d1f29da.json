Lachy thought I was stretching the meaning too much, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m on the fence. 2nd opinion?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:52): i don't understand why &lt;mark&gt; would even remotely be appropriate there, but maybe i'm lacking imagination... what argument would you use to defend it? :-)",

        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (09:54): Lachy suggested it should be informationally relevant, not relevant to current action",

        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (09:54): i was thinking about getting started on it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:55): 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: &quot;highlighted for reference purposes&quot; seems a bit of a stretch since your default style is to hide it :-)",

        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (09:55): now that the parser work is winding down, i should get back to URL stuff",

        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (09:56): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: well, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s highlighted for reference when the action of getting the permalink is relevant :)",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (09:56): ok, seems I was a little too creative in reading the spec. thanks :)",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:56): that reminds me.. I need to setup that daily cron job on my server to push the latest spec revisions to that github mirror",

        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (09:57): you don't think we'll run into less trouble later if we output something that the URI spec can parse?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:57): 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: maybe with a (normative) appendix that defines the semantics in terms of an IRI",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:57): 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: the uri spec doesn't define parsing",
        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (09:58): oh, i thought there was a regular expression in the appendix that did the parsing",

        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (09:58): i see",

        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (09:58): one annoying thing is that the parsing depends on whether the UA understands a given scheme",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:59): 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: i think we're better off just defining the parsing once and being done with it",
        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (09:59): ok",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:59): 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: (we can mostly defer to iri/uri for validity definitions, though)",
        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (09:59): we're going to run into trouble later on, but we can deal with that then",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:00): 8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21: there are three, i think - parsing, resolving, and canonicalisation/serialisation",
        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (10:00): ok, that includes default ports and whether the scheme uses the authority-style",
        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (10:00): oh, yeah resolving",
        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (10:01): i haven't gotten to that one",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:01): the &quot;authority-style&quot; thing is mostly gone in the more recent specs, iirc",

        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (10:01): but yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:02): my point is i think we can draw a line in the sand and make it Just Work in the future for future schemes, at least for unknown ones",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:02): and define what's known",
