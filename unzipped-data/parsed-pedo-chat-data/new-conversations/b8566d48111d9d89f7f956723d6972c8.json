        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:03): I tried to compile it, but &quot;configure&quot; script, reports that freebsd6.1 is not supported",

        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:08): tomcat version is 5.5.17, java vm is diablo-jdk 1.5.0 update 7",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:09): Why do you want to use jsvc?",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:09): I want tomcat in standalone mode on port 80",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:10): Okay, how about using packet filter to remap the connections from port 80 to 8080?",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:11): it is a solution, but strange construction :)",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:12): Try adding this to your /etc/pf.conf:",

        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:13): I see",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:14): I didn't try, I wanted to use jsvc",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:15): I strongly suggest not using jsvc.",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:15): why?",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:16): on home site they say that jsvc should be used for standalone mode",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:17): Well, 1) it doesn't build.  2) even if it did, it may not run correctly.  3) even if it runs correctly, from then on your JVM has to run as a sub process of jsvc, which means you can't send any signals directly to your JVM.  4) it doesn't buy you anything over packet filtering, and it uses up RAM unnecessarily.",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:17): And, I'm saying that through experience, you should *not* use jsvc for standalone mode.",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:20): ok thanks, but i tried to run on 8080 port before, tomcat starts and stops, but doesn't answer",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:22): in windows host it work ok, iven if I didn't touched to configs",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:22): but in uses jsvc",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:23): Well, there is nothing wrong with running Tomcat on port 8080.  It works fine.  If it doesn't work on your machine, maybe you have the wrong port number, or maybe you have a broken Tomcat installation.",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:23): it uses jsvc, sorry, my englisch is very bad",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:24): I installed it from package, compiled for my system",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:25): Your english seems fine, but I don't understand what you mean.  It either runs on port 8080, or it uses jsvc to run on port 80.. not both.",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:26): I've tryed to run without jsvc on 8080, it doisn't answer",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:28): I thought you said jsvc wouldn't compile on your machine?",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (13:29): Anyway, don't run Tomcat with jsvc.  You're already finding out that it does not work properly.",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:29): yes, I thought that in doesn't work at all in standalone without jsvc",

        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:51): should tomcat work with standard configs?",
        "6907a4e1eb65d21e007ad7f5fe4245fd (13:57): on win host it works, if it should on freebsd too, then tomcat broken itself, if not I should dig the configs and smoke manuals :)",
