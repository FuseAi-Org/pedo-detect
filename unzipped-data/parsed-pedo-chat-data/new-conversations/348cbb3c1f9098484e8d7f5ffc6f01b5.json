        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (11:44): lapotok: except for the fact that support for list images is poor, yes.  CSS technically 'can' do that.",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (11:44): you're better off setting the type to none, and using a background image and some padding",
        "95f9d77df4961df199a9352b78c96750 (11:48): thanks!",
        "8905008e00e6be22f585fe93cba1037f (11:49): what browsers dont support list-style-image?",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (11:49): I think (based on something I read a while ago somewhere) that IE and FF support it",
        "8905008e00e6be22f585fe93cba1037f (11:50): yah, they do",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (11:50): but they center the image next to the list item",
        "8905008e00e6be22f585fe93cba1037f (11:50): oh?",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (11:50): so if you have a 5 line item, the marker will appear in on the third line",
        "8905008e00e6be22f585fe93cba1037f (11:50): its worked well for me",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (11:50): not on the top",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (11:50): or bottom...or wherever you want it",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (11:51): I haven't seen any real support issues with it...just that it, often times, isn't what you want",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (11:51): and the ability to make it do what you want isn't provided",
        "70cf233561346a11a652a39cf7c98944 (12:13): I am looking for an interesting css property, one that states that if someone selects text or images within a certain area, that there is *NO* indication that they have selected anything (i.e. no highlighting) --- can anyone help?",
        "6cc33fc59f5834698e673094ecaae5f8 (12:16): CarlH, you mean when they hover over a link, or are you trying to change click-and-drag text highlighting&gt;",
        "6cc33fc59f5834698e673094ecaae5f8 (12:16): ?",
        "70cf233561346a11a652a39cf7c98944 (12:16): I am talking about click and drag highlighting",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:16): carlh: I doubt that css property exists, but I also doubted that a css property for the boxy thing around selected links existed",
        "70cf233561346a11a652a39cf7c98944 (12:17): The problem is this...",
        "70cf233561346a11a652a39cf7c98944 (12:17): when you select a certain size area",
        "70cf233561346a11a652a39cf7c98944 (12:17): the whole *PAGE* appears selected",
        "70cf233561346a11a652a39cf7c98944 (12:17): which looks really bad",
        "70cf233561346a11a652a39cf7c98944 (12:17): I am trying to find away around that",
        "6cc33fc59f5834698e673094ecaae5f8 (12:17): CarlH, that sounds more like a browser bug - which browser are you testing in&gt;",
        "70cf233561346a11a652a39cf7c98944 (12:17): IE",
        "6cc33fc59f5834698e673094ecaae5f8 (12:18): try a real browser first, see if FF or Opera do that...",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:28): madpilot: I've had FF do it",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:29): it's the browser thinking it's smarter than you",
        "6cc33fc59f5834698e673094ecaae5f8 (12:29): I don't think I've ever seen Opera do that",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:30): some pages which don't have valid closed table tags cause that problem for me",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:30): (table based layout, only the tags weren't closed properly...I assume FF thought it was helping me by selecting the entire table)",
        "6cc33fc59f5834698e673094ecaae5f8 (12:31): fun...",
        "6cc33fc59f5834698e673094ecaae5f8 (12:31): happen to remember a page that does that?",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:32): no...it isn't common",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:40): madpilot: this is just an example (doesn't have that proble) <a href=\"http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=532453\">http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=532453</a> start selecting on the right side menu options and drag over into the left side content",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:41): notice how all of the content up to where you selected in the menu options gets selected?",
        "6cc33fc59f5834698e673094ecaae5f8 (12:41): very strange - nifty browser bug...",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:43): Newhydra: Why do you consider that a bug?",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:43): I would says it behaves exactly as expected",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:44): nope",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:44): as I said, that was just an example",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:44): the bug is when people don't close their tags",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:44): so it thinks I've left a table/entered a new one",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:44): and selects a bunch of stuff I didn't want selected",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:45): (it isn't a browser bug, though...not much the browser can do about an invalid page)",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:45): right :)",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:45): You can vliadate user input though",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:46): validate user input...?",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:46): forgive me, but...what does that have to do with anything? ;)",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:47): Then you can fix non-closed tags and avoid your problem",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:47): no, I mean developers who don't know what they're doing",
        "7861457b3f716c95ced114fde2cdd325 (12:47): or just don't validate",
        "df52db578d711579b9cc26c94d8b3d41 (12:50): oh, souded like you had a cms where you couldnt control the html completely :)"
