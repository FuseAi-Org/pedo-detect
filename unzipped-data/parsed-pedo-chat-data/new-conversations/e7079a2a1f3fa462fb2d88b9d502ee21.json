        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (15:43): I'm trying to figure out if something is possible",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (15:43): for example",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (15:45): view a website with multiple pages....     if user clicks a button &quot;Save for Offline&quot;    that particular page is now cached or saved in local storage",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (15:45): so the user can view it offline now",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (15:58): okay so i've done some reading and I think this might be doable",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (15:59): so to start with something basic im goign to try to save a webpage with some images into local storage ansd attempt to view it offline",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (15:59): somehow....",

        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (16:07): I was going to read that after some other misc work",

        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (16:33): which app are you using for authoring SVG files?",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (16:34): Inkscape is a bit sluggish, are there any alternatives besides Illustrator and SVGEdit?",

        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (16:37): is there any hope that next release of Expression Design will support SVG?",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (16:37): all browsers are supporting SVG now, but we have no tools",

        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:53): If SVG finally picks up steam, I'm sure the quality of the output will be prioritized in the future by tool vendors.",

        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (16:58): bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8: it's not like HTML where you could code things manually. E.g. drawing a complex path would take a lot of time",

        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:59): Right, so you export your mailbox or whatever from Illustrator and call it a day",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (16:59): c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6: are you aware of the Scour tool from JEff Schiller?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (16:59): that really helps clean up output from Inkscape or Illustator",

        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:59): I find using compound paths generated in Illustrator to slot quite nicely into Rapha?\u00b4l",

        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (17:00): 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6: Inkscape-generated groups have awkward transforms such as translate(-1878.682,-1983.51432)",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (17:01): oh, right",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (17:01): yeah, that really sucks",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (17:01): it's more than just the float precision, 8289720c65ae7948d98fb2bafa9f7834",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (17:01): it does funky stuff with transforms, and with gradient chains, and all sorts of foulness",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (17:02): I've noticed that problem as well",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (17:03): it also sucks that both Inkscape and Illustrator are using custom renderers",
