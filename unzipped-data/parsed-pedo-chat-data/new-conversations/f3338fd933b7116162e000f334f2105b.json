        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:52): one, using a DBA user for normal processing is foolish",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:52): two, DBA is a ROLE, not direct priilege grants",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:52): so it COULD be the role is causing the problem",
        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (17:53): the user also have the delete any table privilege and the sysdba privilege",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:53): but, since you don't say WHAT you're doing with this trigger who can tell what is REALLY occurring",
        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (17:53): it's only a development server, so it's not important. the rest is on an oracle dba",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:53): so it isn't important for you to know what is happening, just how to fix it ... gee, that's smart",

        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (17:55): no, i want to know whats happening but step by step... as first it should work then i want to know the why ^^ it's a little bit stressy today",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:55): your implementation is a bit flaky, to say the least",

        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:56): you don't give regular users access to DBA privileges",
        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (17:56): its a pure development envorniment",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:56): I dont' CARE",
        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (17:57): later in production each user will have only the privileges he/she needs",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:57): then you SET UP DEVELOPMENT THAT WAY And get this to work PROPERLY",
        "ac1daa9b95180e1d1333f4dd644fb85e (17:59): .net stored procedures is a nice feature to control windows-os via oracle-db",
        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (17:59): ok, but do you think that this problem is because i gave the user dba?",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (17:59): I think it's because you don't know what you're doing",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (18:00): and if you DO get this to work with 'DBA' then you'll need to go through this same process AGAIN when you assigne PROPER rights to users",
        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (18:01): hmmm...",

        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (18:03): now the user have only create, update and delete table, index and prcedure privileges",

        "833fe8715b469aabed14f0efbc2a8f59 (18:06): ok, but that don't quickly resolve this problem, for learning oracle i ordered three booky by amazon. i'll read them, but this problem i need to solve now",
        "16ef9805bf33329f1375a7f3b63f4569 (18:07): then you absolutely need to read up on PL/SQL and the AUTHID function",
