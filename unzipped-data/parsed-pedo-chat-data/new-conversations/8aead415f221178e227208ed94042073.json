        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:25): where high priority = things that really cause a lot of problems and should definitely be fixed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:26): and low priority = things that cause problems, but not disasters",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:26): so for example a missing &lt;/style&gt; is a high priority error since it hides the whole rest of the page",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:26): wouldn't most content model violation bugs then be low priority?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:27): but a style=&quot;&quot; attribute in a production page is a low priority error since it just means that you can't easily add an alternative style sheet",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:28): now there's a marginally good argument against using style=&quot;&quot; (though it applies equally to &lt;style scoped&gt; and even &lt;style&gt;, no?)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:28): &lt;style&gt; can have a title=&quot;&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:28): (without one it's a &quot;persistent style sheet&quot;)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:29): (but it's easy to migrate from one persistent style sheet to a set of alternatives just by adding titles)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:30): that seems about as good a reason for warning as it would be to warn on onclick because you can't have more than one handler set that way, and additional ones get slightly different behavior (scope chain, etc)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:31): i.e. not completely bogus, but if it were a compiler I'd probably turn that warning off",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:33): and if we're talking mandatory vs. optional diagnostics, then it might be better to leave it up to individual validators to decide what warnings they emit in addition to errors, and compete on usefulness and quality of those",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:33): much as C compilers all give basically the same syntax errors, but compete on usefulness of optional warnings",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:34): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:34): maybe",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:34): (I suspect gcc has far more useful warnings than it would if they were all defined by the C standard)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:34): it wouldn't hurt for the spec to editorially suggest some things as possible optional diagnostics",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:35): I should get going",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:35): ttyl",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:35): (btw some people might find a warning on use of inline event handler attributes actually useful)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:35): (since it's not uncommon to ban them as a house style for a particular site)",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (08:03): hm",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (08:05): I suspect it would work because of how MySQL does things, even though it's not technically a reliable feature",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:05): how would you do it reliably in sql?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (08:06): I can only think of ugly ways at the moment (subqueries and whatnot)",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:14): would be really useful to try to get some more implementors to work on conformance checkers, and for people to use those",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:15): so I think one real risk is that conformance-checker maintainers would start adding &quot;ignore someClassofErrors&quot; options",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:16): due to pressure from users",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:16): how much i care depends on what the error is",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:16): or rather, what i think about it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:17): yeah, of course",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:17): if it's because the spec has some requirement that really doesn't help anyone, then we should change the spec",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (08:24): It gets the newest date for each annotation, and then selects the rows containing those annotation,date pairs",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (08:25): Yeah, MySQL only started doing subqueries recently. Might be 5.0",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (08:26): Could no doubt emulate it with a join on itself and so fancy tricks, though",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:26): you know, maybe i should have implemented the code that actually _adds_ annotations first",
