        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (09:57): HTML5 needs to add some centrally-adminstered artificially scarce resources; the domain name people have got the right idea",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:58): what do you think i'm refusing to allow extensibility of the element names?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (09:59): 0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17: Depends what you're measuring - it's a fairly accurate means of measuring how many pages listed on dmoz.org use a &lt;canvas&gt; element in their markup :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (09:59): and it's not too hopelessly inaccurate to extrapolate that to a larger portion of the web",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (10:00): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yes, as long as you don't conflate use of &lt;canvas&gt; with use of canvas",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (10:02): also I suspect use of canvas is bigger off the traditional web",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (10:02): look at widgets/gadgets",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (10:06): though I don't suppose there's any real reason why I couldn't add code to download scripts",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (10:06): other than laziness",
        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (10:08): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: so, with the new redaction of the 62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fcpcache spec, all HTML documents in an 62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fcplication need to have a manifest attribute, not just the main one. why is this helpful?",
        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (10:10): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I thought of the manifest attribute as something that was only needed once, at the root level",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:10): that's always how it's been, no? as far as i recall it's always has been my intent. why would you serve a page differently based purely on whether you'd loaded another page first?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:10): i don't understand what you mean",

        "62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fc (10:11): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: and that seemed like reasonable behavior to me",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (10:12): Also: XHTML is dying - I saw 39 pages sent as 62c428533830d84fd8bc77bf402512fcplication/xhtml+xml a year ago, and only 35 yesterday",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (10:12): (Don't bother telling me about standard deviations or any of that nonsense - it's definitely dying!)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:13): so once a page has had a manifest, even if you remove the manifest=&quot;&quot; attribute, it'll keep being served from that manifest?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:14): ok well fair enough :-)",
