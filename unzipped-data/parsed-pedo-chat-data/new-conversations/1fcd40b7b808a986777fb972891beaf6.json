        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:02): sensei: it shouldn't fit the slot, let alone work",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:02): Oh okay, damn this memory djungle is thick :)",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:03): I've got an Acer aspire 1362 and want to buy aonther 256 or 512 mb or memory, but it's proven more difficult than I thought",
        "2ad16e9d65d73e6ca3ac0cb6e2ac64d4 (19:07): ehehe",
        "2ad16e9d65d73e6ca3ac0cb6e2ac64d4 (19:07): difficult?",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:07): Yeah, to know what to buy",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:07): I basically suck to death on hardware, I stopped caring when AGP made its entry :)",
        "2ad16e9d65d73e6ca3ac0cb6e2ac64d4 (19:08): if its ddr , just buy a ddr and use",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:09): Okay, but all these MHz and pcXXXX stuff ?",
        "2ad16e9d65d73e6ca3ac0cb6e2ac64d4 (19:09): personally i don't think anyone need more than 256 if doest not use the pc for gaming or heavy graphic designs",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:09): I work from home from time to time, compiling, big IDE's etc..",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:09): sensei: pc3200 = 200mhz = 400fsb",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:10): Okey, so if I buy a memory with 333 mhz, it won't work ?",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:10): sensei: if it's faster than or equal to your fsb it'll work fine",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:10): Ok, but not slower? :)",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:11): slower will either pull your fsb down to that speed, slowing down your whole system, or cause stability issues",
        "2ad16e9d65d73e6ca3ac0cb6e2ac64d4 (19:12): be right back",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:12): DDR333 will not fit in a DDR bus ?",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:13): Standard SO-DIMM DDR 512MB PC-3200   I emailed the store I bought it in, and they said that'd work",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:13): yep that should work fine",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:14): Ok, I can only find 1 gb sticks on ebuyer that's pc3200 :/",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:15): some motherboards can't take 1gb sticks",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:15): <a href=\"http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=22063\">http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=22063</a>  Will that work?",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:16): lol, sorry if I'm behaving like a worrying mother or something, just don't want to get this one wrong",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:16): if it's sodimm DDR, it'll probably work",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:17): Heh, everyone keeps saying 'most likely' and/or 'probably' :P",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:18): <a href=\"http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=22069\">http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=22069</a>  But that looks completely different, but has the same numbers and stuff",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:19): yeah, rotten bastards keep changing shit while keeping the name, and changing names without changing anything else, so you need not only the name and type, but speed and other attributes as well to work out what you're actually looking at",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:19): 's why i'm not going to get a new system anytime soon, upgrade paths are being clobbered way too much these days",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:20): This is really crappy, shouldn't it be in the manufacturers interest to make this as easy as possible?",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:21): Like put a sticker under every laptop with a fscking number on it, and have all hardwaer retailers have the number next to the item.. if they match, go for it",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:21): In fact, that last link I pasted.. that looks just like a normal old SDRAM stick, doesn't it ?",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:23): Hm, only 5 quid.. I'll go with the kingston shite, if it works it works, if it doesn't there'll be blood shed :)",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:24): .. probably from my own forehead",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:26): sensei: ask for a guarantee that it's suitable for your laptop.. then if it's not, you can throw big legal words like &quot;misrepresentation&quot; around ;)",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:27): lol, that's brilliant :)",
        "48cbffb0018e689e433a5e764efd23fa (19:27): Or, I'll just add a few quid and leave it to someone with some knowhow down the street :)",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (19:27): because anything told to you by a salesman while they're on duty is equivalent to a verbal contract from the company",
