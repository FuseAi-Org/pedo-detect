        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:34): JoshBorke: there are no phrases from the samba team which leads to a public release",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:34): Yes we all know that rcsu .. but we kinda wanna know if they have something in mind.. like.. late 2007? never? tomorrow? ;)",

        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:37): Nah, I don't mean a deadline, and didn't mean to imply one. You said public release, and I said I wonder if they have anything in mind.. referring to said term of public release (he said.. being far too formal... ;)",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:37): SpamapS: oh, then i misunderstand you",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:38): but in reality",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:38): samba4 gets developed but currently there is no point visible",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:38): where it can be used in a production environment",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:39): I recall when 3.0 was in such a state.. it was quite sudden when they changed the tune from that, to &quot;ok go ahead and use it!&quot; ;)",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:40): I think it was 2.99 for like.... 6 months and then bam, 3.0.",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:40): yea that was the release schema",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:40): but smaba4 is writen from scratch",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:41): I guess I just wanna get behind it and help push. ;)",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:41): and only a few functions are ported from samba3",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:41): I really hope that samba4 gets a usable state",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:42): but in fact, let samba3 do the file work",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:42): and have samba4 as the auth guru",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:43): I'm surprised there hasn't been any corporate sponsorship of it. I guess having 3.0 able to be a member server serves most of the commercial interests in samba.",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:43): oh no, OSDL is sponsoring",

        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:43): and ... (think ahead=",

        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:44): hrm, but samba3 doesn't meet all the Fileserver needs :-(",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:45): ahh, sponsoring, but not pushing. ;)",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:45): JoshBorke: what doesn't samba3 do that you need?",
        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:45): ACE implementation isn't quite the same.  we can't achieve the same setup we have in windows",
        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:46): you can't remove view permissions in samba where you can in windows",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:47): once you remove view, what is left?",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:47): (I never use ACL's.. and haven't had a windows workstation in 8 years.. so.. I'm a bit clueless on this)",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:49): JoshBorke: thats not the prob of samba",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:49): JoshBorke: its the underlying unix perm system",

        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:50): (mind you, i didn't implement the permissions we are using, i'm just trying to port them)",
        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:51): we basically don't want to give users full control over their toplevel directory, just there sub-directories",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:52): Yeah can't ext3 with extended attributes do that?",
        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:52): almost, but not quite",
        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:52): because the POSIX permissions interfere",
        "f9c5eef23e4e79ee735a7bab11bfa729 (00:52): ah",
        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:52): we have to set the POSIX owner to be a dummy owner so that we can give the permissions to the user without giving them full control",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:53): whats wrong with that",
        "257cb7b31ffd7f0562f521f6442a8fb0 (00:54): it's not manageable from the windows gui that way",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:55): enable the acl on the filesystem and grant the rights to the users",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:55): better, do it with the groups",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:56): and use chmod g+s on directories",

        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:57): but netware is much better",

        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:58): even better than redmond",
        "98dc40de8c10641d8f530a1609692ec5 (00:58): but hard to learn in practice",
