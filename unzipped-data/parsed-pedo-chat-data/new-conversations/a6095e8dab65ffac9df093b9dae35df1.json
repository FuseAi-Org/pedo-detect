        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:06): &quot;malignmark&quot; sounds evil; why would I want that in my graphics?",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (22:07): does sound like a hex doesn't it? ;)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:21): b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: How is your parser coming along? Is it close to usable yet?",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:21): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I'm one test away from passing the html5lib tests",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:22): so, probably fairly usable :)",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:23): I'm currently fighting with scoping and the commented-out bits in the spec that deal with SVG",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:26): cool",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:26): I will have to take a look",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:26): should find some time to work on html5lib as well",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:27): I quite fancy doing some work on html5lib to learn python",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:27): since I know html5-parsing fairly well know",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:48): actually, the C html parser I've been working on is now passing all tests",

        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:53): linux would be much easier, I think",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:53): fefe4c60d912e295e59fd874577ca7f9 (the other developer) has OS X, but I don't know what hoops he jumps through to compile",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (22:54): I think tomorrow I'll take a break from coding and write up API docs",
