        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:05): that is, dealing with actually getting them migrated over, as well as updating the build script and whatever else would be needed",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:05): github seems like it might best place to consider moving to",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:07): for among other reasons the network effects of the fact that there are so many very active developers there",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (20:09): github supports svn, btw",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:13): at least on my part",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:14): I've never been a big subversion fan",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:14): I really that github makes it dead simple to fork repos",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (20:14): github's svn support is actually git-backed. it lets people who aren't yet comfortable with git use something familiar while the other collaborators forge on ahead with git",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:14): ah, I see",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:14): well that's good then",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (20:15): e.g. svn checkout http://svn.github.com/sideshowbarker/jsblog.git",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:20): there more I use github, the more I like it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:20): it ain't perfect but it was clearly designed by people with clue",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:21): and in general it just seems to work the way a system like that ought to",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:22): the ease of forking and the culture really encourage experimentation",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:23): I think getting the validator.nu sources available there might help a lot toward getting some code contributions for yet-to-be-implemented features and bugs too",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (20:23): it'd raise more awareness about it and hopeflly get some more good devs involved",
