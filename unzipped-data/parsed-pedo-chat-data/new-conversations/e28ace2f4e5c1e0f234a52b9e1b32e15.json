        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:31): you know, I've been thinking, the really large number of things that have gotten added to the platform over the last 3 years especially, all this stuff getting implemented, e.g., latest news about new features in IE10",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:32): those are clear signs that we are all doing something wrong",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:34): and instead we should use that time to discuss stuff like &quot;consider reducing verbosity when talking about code points&quot;",
