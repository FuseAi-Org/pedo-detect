        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:20): mp3 isn't royalty-free.  What do you mean &quot;not failing properly&quot;?",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:21): if it refused to play it and displayed the fallback code, that would be lovely",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:21): I coudl put the flash emebd inside the audio tag",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:21): but instead it displays a completely useless grey box with an X in it",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:21): so I am going to have to default to flash",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:22): if I want to use audio declaratively",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:22): That's not how &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; are supposed to fail.  Their fallback contents are for legacy browsers, not for unsupported codecs.",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:22): yes, adn that supposition si wrong",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:23): It's not &quot;wrong&quot;.  It can't be.  It can be different than what you want, though.",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:23): er",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:23): Anyway, just throw a tiny bit of javascript at it that asks the &lt;audio&gt; if it can play mp3s, and replaces it if it can't.",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:23): I am saying that the spec is wrong",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:24): because it breaks if I write declarative code",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:24): No, the spec can be different thatn what you expect, or suboptimal.  It can't be &quot;wrong&quot; in this case, because it's not declaring a statement of fact.",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:25): the spec is misdesigned then",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:25): happy now?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:25): Yes. ^_^",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:26): Anyway, the discussion about &lt;audio&gt;/&lt;video&gt; fallback has been had several times.  It is almost certain not to be changed at this point, because the way you want it to act requires crazy code on the browser side.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:27): What happens, for example, if your &lt;audio&gt; starts with no playable &lt;source&gt;s, but then you later add one it can play with js?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:27): Does it stop and tear down the Flash?  Does it ignore the new &lt;source&gt;?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:28): Does this mean that the order in which you insert &lt;source&gt;s and other contents can have an effect on what happens?",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:29): so instead you require crazy code on the client side",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:29): You have a very low definition of &quot;crazy&quot;.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:30): It's like three lines, plus whatever js is necessary to do an embed.",
        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:33): hi",
        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:34): I've got a question about WebSocket. Are you sure the handshake is good to be GET?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (01:34): 132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5: It's easier to offer Vorbis than to do a Flash fallback :-)",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:34): no it fucking isn't",
        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:34): I've understood GET can be cached and such.",
        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:35): so it makes me wonder, shouldn't it be POST -method?",
        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:35): Firefox will happily route an mp3 to a plgin if I use &lt;iframe&gt;",
        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:35): for anything else, I happily ignore flash if I can.",

        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:35): or embed",

        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:36): course Android is worse",

        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:36): except no formats at all",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (01:37): 132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5: huh. that's silly",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:37): Agreed, that's pretty silly.",

        "132ea029b178e3c6d3a3aa4521ea24a5 (01:37): yes, I'm talking about the one with an installed base",

        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:38): why such complicated handshaking mechanism? why three keys?",
        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:39): also, where's UDP?",
        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:39): (which would be a welcome introduction)",
        "1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403 (01:40): and.. that's it. pretty much other in websocket makes sense to me.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:41): The handshake is to avoid various security problems.  A lot of care is needed, since any web page can trigger a WebSocket request, so the browser needs to be sure it's not being abused somehow.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:41): (dunno all the specifics)",
        "71bd9426656c7068876f52fb7934af7f (01:41): 1c9e518ecc70c615032a33d467081403, UDP would need a different protocol and NAT/firewall/proxy traversal work",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:41): UDP doesn't fit into those requirements at all.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:42): You'd have to get rid of the handshake, but then you need something else to ensure security (like what?).",
        "71bd9426656c7068876f52fb7934af7f (01:42): I am interested in the thinking behind the three key design. Has that been described in public?",
