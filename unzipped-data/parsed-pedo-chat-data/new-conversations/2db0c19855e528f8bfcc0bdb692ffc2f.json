        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:16): What are you using the verify ram speed?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:16): im wondering if anyone would know any reason a mobo would do that other than it being defective and in need of an RMA",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:16): im using memtest on the latest knoppix cd",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:16): its seeing the cas speed fine",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:16): And what speed is it reporting?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:17): reading the ram as 177mhz",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:17): DDR354",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:17): tried a second program for verification?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:17): nope, fresh build",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:17): now it is a conroe",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:17): Tried setting the memory option to manual in the bios?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:17): so maybe the stuff might read a lil funky but I doubt it",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:18): oh you know what",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:18): hold on beb",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:18): its locked on ddr400",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:19): the rest I set myself @ 2.5-3-3-8",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:19): ill install something and run some benchmarks",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:20): im not too worried about it really",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:20): so memory stuff isnt set to auto?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:21): no",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:21): kk",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:21): it wont let me switch the mem speed",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:21): but the cpu fsb reads as 266",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:21): and thats not right either",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:22): so its prob just memtes",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:22): its a 1066 fsb cpu",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:22): Try setting bios defaults?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:22): bios defaults was lik 4-4-4-10 or something horrid",
        "d0e111cff6bd7d214c4beed83c5d9660 (11:22): 6-6-6-6",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:23): My computers POSSESSED",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:23): seriously I dont care as long as it memtests at this point",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:23): right, I mean set defaults and reconfigure stuff",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:23): I had to do that on a NF2 board once",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:23): ill be upgrading to a better mobo later on, as long as it runs and I cn game on it im cool",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:23): it might be the speedstep stuff too",
        "d0e111cff6bd7d214c4beed83c5d9660 (11:24): AAAAHHH",
        "d0e111cff6bd7d214c4beed83c5d9660 (11:24): SATAN IS COMING OUT MY FLOPPY DRIVE",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:25): its the mem multiplier",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:26): either memtest is reading it wrong or its off a bit or something, if I need to ill put windoze on it and call asrock",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:27): weird thing is it didnt even boot when it was set to auto",
        "a5cf518cc5394e224df4c1b2d016e4a8 (11:27): maybe the ram isnt playing nice?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:27): ram is reccommended",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:27): pardon my spelling",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:28): I can't think of any reason why a P4-type system would want to force a 2/3 divider on to the RAM, it doesn't with with any of the FSB/RAM speed combinations I can think off",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:28): the cpu is 1066 and the ram is ddr400",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:29): the cpu is 1066fsb and the ram is ddr400",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:29): sorry - my pc lagged there for a second",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:30): ChickenTalons: that requires a 3/4 divider, not 2/3",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:30): I dont know what to tell you - the multiplier on the cpu is 7",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:32): The closest I can come up with is that it thinks you have DDR333 (166Mhz) RAM but it's slightly off",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:32): so its forcing a 6/7 ?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:32): i think its underclocking",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:33): so the fsb on my cpu IS 266",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:33): ChickenTalons: it is for DDR400, for DDR333 it's not",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:33): ChickenTalons: yes, you get 1066 from what Intel calls &quot;quad-pumping&quot;",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:33): well when it boots, and in the bios its says ddr400 and it is greyed out and wont let change the speed",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:33): let me",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:34): For DDR400 you need a 3/4 multiplier, for some reason your board is forcing a 2/3",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:38): its cant be, the cpu multiplier is 7 and the cpu speed is correct",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:38): 1862MHz",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:38): maybe memtest just doesnt read it right, let me let it finish testing, tehn ill see whats up",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:39): 7 * 266 = 1862 yes, but 266 * 2/3 = 177",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:40): 266 * 3/4 on the other hand, gives you 199Mhz which is what you need for DDR400",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:40): damnit - looks like RMA time",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:40): In any case though, the BIOS should be able to configure that automatically, especially since it seems to be able to detect that your ram is in fact ddr400",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:41): I wonder what setting that would be",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:41): and if the memory multiplier was wrong, wouldn't I be getting MAD errors in memtest?",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:42): ChickenTalons: not if it's lower than the memory is rated for",

        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (11:42): ChickenTalons: are you absolutely sure it's DDR400? One possibility, admittedly quite remote, is that it *is* DDR333 and for some reason your BIOS is displaying 400",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (11:44): no, its ddr400, ive been using it for a while, works great",
