        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:01): hello, can someone here help me? I have an app that I'd like for it to be packaged for Solaris x86/sparc (it is already already packaged for Windows, Linux (rpm,deb), Mac (works via cmake .; make .) - no packager yet) - if someone can help w/ packaging I'd really appreciate it. Since I am already doing package management, QA/testing, devel, and project management... it makes it a bit hard to also package for opensolaris",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:01): the package that i'm refering to is <a href=\"http://pdiff.sf.net\">http://pdiff.sf.net</a>",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:02): the only dependencies that it has are for libtiff, libpng, and (c)make",

        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:05): oh i can make solaris packages -- i'm looking for a maintainer though",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:05): i have my hands full atm",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:06): i'm creating and testing rpms, debs on SuSE, RH, CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian",

        "571055a4bff9fb6ea675d38374df3460 (13:08): It's possible that www.blastwave.org can help you, but I don't know how they select or maintainer their repository.  Doesn't sourceforge already give you access to Solaris x86/sparc and other such platforms?  I'd think that you could run automated tests and builds through them.",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:09): i'm not sure as to the extent that they can help w/ their compiler farms",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:10): i'd just like to have someone be able to test/update the package",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:10): i can create the initial one, but I don't want to keep updating/testtting it",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:11): i would prefer another maintainer over doing it myself",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:11): i already feel over worked doing the rpm/deb packaging and testing :)",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:12): not to mention the fact that every distro has their own hoops to jump through",
        "571055a4bff9fb6ea675d38374df3460 (13:13): You could take the classical solution and not build any packages at all.",
        "c84247cefeb3a07c65c26753231e17f7 (13:13): best would be to contact blastwave i think",

        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:18): besides, then you get people who package it and then don't tell you",
        "e7e98fe845037733a8d2be68e4a65e3d (13:19): so when you develop a package, then you have issues",
