        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:26): i was browing on going to log onto wolfenstein.com recently.. and ran into on of thoes age gates... so i started filling it in and accidentaly wrote &quot;82 80 1982&quot; instead of &quot;82 08 1982&quot; and the site locked me out.... so i got annoyed... but i started thinking.... would it not make sense if the movie and games industry came together with the browser vendors to make a microformat...",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:26): to do age rating on sites which the parental controls of the browser can then pick up on...",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:27): that makes a lot more sense to me and feels like it would work very well as a microformat.",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:28): anyone here?",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:44): or has someone allready thaught of this and utterly failed to grab anyones attention about the idea... seams unlikely.. to me it feels like such a perfect solution...",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:44): why is no one ever around when you have a neat idea!",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:45): sigh",

        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:46): Well, actually, I'm quite sick, so maybe only 50",
        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:46): 50%, rather",

        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:48): Of course, the other version is to switch the month into named form, rather than numeral",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:48): ah... i mean the microformat would expose what ratings the game would have... so its more an issue of what ratings are used in various regions..",
        "c74f596e4fe95fc3bb8726dbde2031b0 (10:49): ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2: That's not going to be legally binding",
        "c74f596e4fe95fc3bb8726dbde2031b0 (10:49): The point of entering a birth date is that the user has stated they are of a certain age",
        "c74f596e4fe95fc3bb8726dbde2031b0 (10:49): For legal reasons",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:49): well just how legaly binding is it if a 10 year old claims he is 90?",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:49): he cant sign an agrement....",

        "c74f596e4fe95fc3bb8726dbde2031b0 (10:50): His parents would likely be liable",
        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:50): In terms of microformats, there are then two parts.",

        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:50): only what the lawyers say",

        "c74f596e4fe95fc3bb8726dbde2031b0 (10:51): Otherwise typing my name in a box and hitting &quot;I agree&quot; would not be a legally binding signature :P",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:51): well cant the browser check age validation the first time a agre rated site is visited?",
        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:51): 2. The site could use a stanard set of classnames for the day/month/year form fields, and browsers existing auto-complete funtionality could be enhanced to respond to them",
        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:52): In microformats as they stand, we don't have granular classnames for dates, though.",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:52): oh well at least i hope the wolfensite.com sites creator gets fried and rehired and fired again!",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:52): the site accepted the date &quot;82 80 1982&quot;!!!",

        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:53): age gates are to annoying",
        "c74f596e4fe95fc3bb8726dbde2031b0 (10:53): benward: I think HTML5 has some new date input field, although support for that is obviously a ways out",

        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:53): That's outside the scope of microformats.",

        "c74f596e4fe95fc3bb8726dbde2031b0 (10:54): benward: That's a perfectly sane fallback.  Most webby languages have a nice date parser around",
        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:54): Which is fantastic, in a technical progressive enhancement way. But, I suspect, the user experience of entering a full date in a single field, will cause errors.",
        "f272e016a8281484e7e688a2cf296031 (10:54): Sites use separate input fields for day/month/year for a reason",

        "c74f596e4fe95fc3bb8726dbde2031b0 (10:55): Hmm, maybe.  People are used to writing out full dates.  I guess if they went for an XX/YY/ZZ approach there would be trouble",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:56): why cant it just ask are you over over 18 or wher ever the country reqires... yes no....",
        "ae2616b2b7f8bd9e7d2d5c567a80e5a2 (10:56): then its a matter of internationalization...",
