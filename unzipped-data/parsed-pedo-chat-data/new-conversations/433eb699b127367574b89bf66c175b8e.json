        "4254b29d664a79df391e68a0c28e4008 (02:01): ecdemo: well, in practice, users are pretty good at signaling ops when something disruptive happens.  nobody really sees a pressing need for bots to do the same",
        "2f6a50a9968436f8e95520c37eac80ce (02:01): ecdemo: if the bot knows that abuse is happening, it usually just deals with it",
        "2f6a50a9968436f8e95520c37eac80ce (02:02): in any event, if you think bots would be capable of doing it, feel free to write them and test them out on other channels/networks",
        "f54fafbcfa2b4bd9c634a9834f63afdd (02:02): what if you were testing a new kind",

        "f54fafbcfa2b4bd9c634a9834f63afdd (02:03): then I guess the bot could either log the event or signal it",

        "24acad12f47cfa0456094954cc69a738 (02:04): ecdemo: i think these processes have been hashed out for close to 15 years.  Bots respond to behavior and take actions, it's not really covering any new ground in the IRC world.",
        "4254b29d664a79df391e68a0c28e4008 (02:04): ecdemo: yeah, we could always allow a bot into the channel which logs its actions rather than just taking action.  then after a few days we could review the logs, along with the actual irc transcripts, and see how good its decisions really are",
        "c02d4ce529127a94b302e167ea92a165 (02:04): Cybodog: know what?",

        "0efe2b90deb00e1c60a865c6a2df9958 (02:04): To set the time in debian, use date --set. The truly enlightened user, however, will install ntpdate and ntp-simple to have their clock set automatically on reboot, and slewed to match time servers, respectively. You may also need to run tzconfig and make sure you have the right UTC setting in /etc/default/rcS first.",

        "4254b29d664a79df391e68a0c28e4008 (02:06): bab: works fine on architectures where the boot firmware gives the kernel some direct API for serial port output, so that the kernel doesn't have to initialise its own serial driver before outputting any messages.  all real unix workstations have firmware that does this, peecees often do not",
