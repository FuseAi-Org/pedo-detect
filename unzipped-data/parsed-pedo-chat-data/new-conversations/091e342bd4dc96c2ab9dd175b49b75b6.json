        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:23): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: I do not know",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (03:24): Presumably long before HTML5 makes it to CR, unless the W3C wants to not participate in HTML development anymore after all.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:24): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: I believe we would likely have to recharter to do that, and the chairs asked to hold recharter discussions til after we get to LC",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:24): oh yes, my hope is that it's rather soon, though of course, I am not the only one with input",

        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:29): i didn't know that was a poll option",

        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:30): I think we should just use the Date.now() timeline",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:30): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: and have everything break when the clock changes?",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:31): yeah",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:31): because that's going to break Web pages anyway",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:31): why not try to do better?",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:31): so, don't do that",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (03:31): ES5 says &quot;The now function return a Number value that is the time value designating the UTC date and time of the occurrence of the call to now.&quot;",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:31): who are you directing not to do that?",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:31): users with computers that use ntp?",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:32): yep",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:32): there's not a computer in the world with a clock that never adjusts",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:32): my understanding is that usually those adjustments can be made without going backwards",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:32): and if that's not true, it should be!",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:32): in practice they are not",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:32): then fix that",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:33): you're gonna fix leap seconds for us?",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:33): that sounds awesome!",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:33): fixing that is actually easier than fixing all the Web pages (and other stuff, I suspect) that depend on Date.now and equivalents not going backwards",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:33): well, i don't want to define a Date.now() equivalent either",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:34): in some systems there's a distinction between datetime values, which correspond to real-world dates and times, and intervals",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:34): I would handle leap seconds by just holding the clock constant for one second",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:35): for animations and performance monitoring you care about intervals only",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:35): it would actually be pretty trivial in the browser to record the last reported time and never report anything less than that",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:35): that would handle most of the issues",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:35): and most animation libraries do that for Date.now()",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:35): if someone's clock is just wrong, well, you lose",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:35): it's not useful for the performance monitoring case",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:35): because it biases measurements",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:35): for animations and performance monitoring you don't care about a 1-second pause once a year",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:36): yes, but in the real world NTP clock adjustments are much more frequent than that",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:36): ntp and other clock adjusting processes",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:36): how frequent? and how large?",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:36): there were quite a few reports of inconsistent timestamps from early navigation timing implementations",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:37): i think typically on the order of seconds",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:37): links?",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:40): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: here's one thread on the issue http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-perf/2011Apr/0029.html",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:43): thanks",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:43): the conclusion in that thread seems satisfactory",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:43): another issue is that the APIs available to say &quot;please tell me the current time relative to the unix epoch&quot; are more expensive and less precise than the APIs for &quot;please tell me how long it was since some point in this process' past&quot; as the latter is often just reading off a cpu counter",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:44): 353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320: I thought Chrome used a hybrid approach?",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:44): a hybrid approach is easy enough to do",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:44): yeah, but since we have to slew there can be some error",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:44): that's similar to what Boris suggested and the thread concluded, really",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:44): on windows the slewing error can accumulate into the measurable range",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:45): We could use the same &quot;document time&quot; for animation too",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:45): yeah, if such a thing existed",
        "353fa4cc248867e98de9cab7d122c320 (03:45): something like 'milliseconds since the document was created, ignoring any changes to the system clock'",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:46): I mean what that thread ended up concluding"
