        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:56): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: what about &quot;no other references&quot; maybe?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:56): i dunno that it even needs to be there at all, i mean, if you're looking up a term in an index, and there's only one reference, that's ok",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:57): OK",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:57): I will it so",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:57): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: not sure what to do about the conflicting terms... &quot;align&quot; in particular looks weird",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:57): I will make it so",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:57): yeah",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:57): that's one of the downsides",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:58): I can maybe work on figuring out how to merge those",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:58): &quot;command&quot; is similarly kind of a disaster",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:58): there's four of them and even i don't know which is which :-)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:58): heh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:58): oh you know what would be cool? if you could detect if the &lt;dfn&gt;ing instance used &lt;code&gt; or not",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:59): so that elements got styled &quot;correctly&quot; in the index",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:59): dunno how easy that would be",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:59): that's doable",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:59): that's easy",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:59): cool",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:59): this is awesome, i really love this index",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:59): I think I could also deal with the align. command, etc., stuff by having anolis do another pass on the contents",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:00): can't wait to see what it looks like for complete.html :-D",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:00): and merging stuff",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:00): heh",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:00): yeah",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:00): I will say that this is going to slow down your build/checkin times",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:00): when you make changes",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:00): dunno if you care",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:00): a lot of the duplicates are in the non-conforming section, which makes merging them ok",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:00): it's the other ones i'm worried about",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:00): OK",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:00): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: does it slow down anolis? Or just the splitter?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:00): or what?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:01): anolis, mainly.. on my machine it takes about 6 minutes to have it build the author view",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:01): oh yikes",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:02): there might be some way I can speed it up, I dunno",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:02): maybe we can have the spec splitters do the anolis pass as well",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:02): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:02): right now i subcontract out to jgraham's pimpmyspec for the anolis part, get one file back, then subcontract out to annevk and Philip`'s spec splitters, which send be tarballs back.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:03): hmm",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:03): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:03): but if i could just send a source file to anne and Philip` that would work fine for me too",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:03): that can be combined for sure",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:03): well i only do the splitting once i checkin at the moment",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:03): it's all python",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:03): ah, OK",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:03): and the anolis part when i regen",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:03): I see",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:04): the anolis part was not terrifically fast before anyway",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:04): I can't remember how long it took but it was a minute or two, it seemed like",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:04): the splitter is much faster",
