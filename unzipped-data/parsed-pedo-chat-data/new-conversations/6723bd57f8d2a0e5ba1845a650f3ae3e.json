        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (01:56): 'They've spent, what seems to me, a lot of time promoting this attribute, and accessibility in general. And now, a few people just want to yank it because &quot;it's not being used right&quot;.' -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:00): yup",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:09): &quot;wow.  fascinating.  depressing.&quot; - that's an appropriate response to pretty much any attempt to look at a random collection of real-world markup",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:10): Or humanity in general :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:10): I hope nobody is going to notice that there's some weird euc-jp decoding issues on my table-summary-values-dotbot page where it inexplicably misses the '&quot;' at the end of an attribute value",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:11): (I assume it's an euc-jp decoding issue because all the offending values look kind of Japanese or something foreign like that)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:11): (I can't reproduce the problem with parsetree.validator.nu but I don't care enough to debug it further)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:12): Shouldn't the URL show whether it's Japanese or not?",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:14): Well, I just clicked the expand link in your summary table :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:15): You could look for some of the values lower down that have strings like &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot; in them",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:16): and see if those are .jp pages",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:16): one that charges a flat rate",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:16): I'm surprised by how well Shelly wrote those emails about summary.  Is she the same Shelly who's been complaining about RDFa stuff?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:16): and not per bit",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:17): Maybe they charge per byte, so it still costs the same if he only downloads 7 bits",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:21): (so I got one that's \u00ac\u00a315/GB and doesn't expire for 6 months, which is better value when I don't use it much)",
