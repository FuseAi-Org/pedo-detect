        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (20:19): there does seem to be a strong expert-bias in public-html",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:23): b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: what do you mean by expert-bias?",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (20:25): the comment that brought it about was Philip Taylor's &quot;allowing the craziness of a small number of individuals to outweigh the combined wisdom of all those who formulated the specification for HTML 4.01&quot;",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (20:27): the idea being that an expert's opinion is worth far more than anyone else's, in short",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:27): b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: curiously, those who formulated HTML 4.01 are automatically assumed to have had wisdom whereas those who formulate HTML 5 aren't",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:27): I guess that happens when a spec is old enough",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (20:27): interesting how people acquire mythical status over time. :)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:28): yeah, despite the fact that we have a whole 10 years worth of real world evidence that the HTML4 WG didn't have",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:31): why don't we just continue using SGML? fuck the real world, it keeps us consistent with the wisdom of HTML 4.01",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:33): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, XML is the future, SGML failed",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:33): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: but that goes against the wisdom of the old HTML WG!",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:34): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: and they must be right!",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:34): the old HTMLWG already began the migration to XML as soon as it became available",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:34): they ditched HTML4 after XHTML1",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (20:34): I imagine who you define as an expert is a function of how much your views and theirs match up. :)",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:35): defines self as idiot",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:35): Did they actually care about SGML when writing HTML4, or did they just keep using it because that's what the previous versions of HTML used?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:35): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: IIRC it's that they didn't want to reverse engineer everything",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:36): it changed from HTML WG to XHTML2 WG earlier this year",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:36): so yeah",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:37): I'm sure they just kept using it based on the wisdom of those who wrote HTML 3.2 using SGML",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:37): which was in turn based on the wisdom of those who wrote HTML2",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:37): which was actually not based on the wisdom of TBL who didn't originally use SGML when he first created it",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:38): which was based on the criticism of the IIIR-HTML draft?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:38): So they were following the SGML cow path? :-)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:38): was I even born when the IIIR-HTML draft was written?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:38): 1993. ah good. I was alive!",

        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (20:39): did they have cowpaths back then? :)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:39): what does IIIR stand for?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:40): ah, Integration of Internet Information Resources Working Group",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:40): They should have called it the I3R",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:40): looking it up on Wikipedia gives a search page, results including &quot;Transsexual sexuality&quot; :\\",
