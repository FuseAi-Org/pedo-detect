        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:15): anyone see anything wrong with that?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:16): the alternatives are to have a magical base resolution mechanism and simply ignoring stray &lt;base&gt; tags",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:16): ie7 ignores stray &lt;base&gt;s, doesn't it?",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:16): (or is that in standards mode only?)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:16): probably both",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:17): as in, &quot;yes&quot; to both questions, probably",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:17): right. and we want to deal with quirks :)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:17): (at least if the web relies on them)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:17): i wonder if i have some data on &lt;base&gt; elements",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:18): it amused me when ms decided to ignore stray &lt;base&gt;s... obviously they based their implementation on document conformance requirements in html4",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:19): about 5% of sites have 1 &lt;base&gt; tag, apparently",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:20): 0.03% have 2",
        "bc75c2548b71aed454f81ac6897bd078 (02:20): uses base",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:20): 0.0017% have 3",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:20): but does defining it with xml:base work? i mean if there are multiple &lt;base&gt;s in the same parent",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:20): and a few thousand have more than 3",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:21): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: i would make the xml:base be set on every element until the next &lt;base&gt;, i guess",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:21): ah. right",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:22): so we're talking about a few million pages here",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:22): with 2 or more &lt;base&gt; elements",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:22): i wonder how many have the same URI in both &lt;base&gt; elements",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:22): there might be pages that use only one but have it in the middle",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:23): so a few million pages use two different values for &lt;base&gt;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:26): so if you serialize to xml, do you drop the &lt;base&gt;s?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:33): yeah, dunno",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:33): needs to study this more",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:34): my main concern with supporting &lt;base&gt; in XHTML is that it means URI resolution will be different in XHTML UAs than pure XML UAs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:34): but i guess i can point the topic at myself",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:35): ah. so you'd like to drop support for &lt;base&gt; in xhtml5 completely?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:35): that's what the spec says today iirc",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:35): but people have argued against that",
        "bc75c2548b71aed454f81ac6897bd078 (02:36): I like base",
        "bc75c2548b71aed454f81ac6897bd078 (02:36): it makes it easy to develop entire websites and then move the whole thing",
        "bc75c2548b71aed454f81ac6897bd078 (02:36): only thing you need to change is a variable somewhere",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:36): you like &lt;base&gt;, or you like the concept of having a base URI?",
        "bc75c2548b71aed454f81ac6897bd078 (02:36): base URI",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:36): it says authors must not use it in xml. afaict it doesn't say uas must ignore it in xml",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:36): ok well that's fine, nobody's talking about removing that feature :-)",
        "bc75c2548b71aed454f81ac6897bd078 (02:37): ah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:37): we're just talking about the syltax",
        "bc75c2548b71aed454f81ac6897bd078 (02:37): pipes down",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:37): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: ah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:37): hehe",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:38): today, browsers don't ignore &lt;base&gt; in xml, but since 0.00% of the web use xml it might not be much of an issue to change that :)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:39): :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:39): yeah, especially since 95% of pages don't use base stuff at all",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:39): so that'd make it 5% of 0.00% :-)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:39): indeed :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:41): I guess a physicist would call that 0.000%",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:42): but &lt;base href&gt; changes the #document base uri. xml:base at best changes the root element's base uri",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:42): (which makes a difference with xhr iirc)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:42): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:44): talking about t-shirts",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:44): it just says &quot;XForms is the automobile.&quot; on it",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:44): I thought xforms was the lightbulb",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:45): and HTML forms is LOAD AX, 1000",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:45): but we really need more declarative syntax for that",
