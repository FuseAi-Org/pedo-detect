        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (18:57): there's a mailiing list, that's all some people need!",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:57): they probably don't realise we've already got a decent spec to start with",

        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (18:58): i plan to lurk for about 10 years",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (18:58): We might have a WD by then, though. Better watch out",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:59): who would determine who has lurked long enough?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (18:59): once MS joins I expect HTML5 will be &quot;officially&quot; submitted in some form to the WG as potential deliverable and then we'll see what happens...",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:59): if it isn't accepted as-is, this group will no-doubt fail",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (19:01): &quot;This sounds like it's beyond HTML WG and into XForms? (Not sure the actual term, but this is more technical than just HTML.)&quot;",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (19:01): ha",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (19:01): waits for someone from the Forms WG to take this as an argument in favor of XForms Transitional",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:02): Next we'll have XHTML2 transitional (and the xslt way doesn't count)",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (19:04): nice point",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:05): What happens if XForms transitional is adopted, but it turns out the gap to XForms is too wide, and a new transitional is needed?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (19:05): then we'll have xforms transitional transitional",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (19:08): the gap to xforms will always be too wide. you can't have a transitional format that is backwards compatible and takes you closer to xforms",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (19:09): as far as I can tell, &quot;Transitional&quot; is marketing, politics or both",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:10): We'll have to hurry up the versions until HTML X then",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (19:11): it's a nice mashup of XForms and Web 2.0 :-)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:11): But it isn't transitional",
