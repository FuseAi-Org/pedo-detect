        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:05): Change is hard, so I guess having a separate tool that can generate both the obsolete text format and a slightly more readable HTML format is the only practical way to move things forward",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:06): and then the fuddy-duddies can be happy that there's an unreadable text version of a spec they'll never want to read anyway, while everyone else can use the better version, assuming there's sufficient links between the two that people won't all get stuck on the old version",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:06): not sure; can't find any looking briefly through my history",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:07): seems like if it's so hard just to update formatting from something obviously well over a decade obsolete and in a way that makes things actively harder to read, something is fatally flawed in the organization, heh",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:07): (flaws in the structure of a standards body? never!)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:09): one might think that if the html wasn't insane you could just apply a different stylesheet ... but, well, it does appear to be insane (everything is a &lt;PRE&gt;)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:09): i guess you could still style over PRE, just sort of weird",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:10): and the markup is probably not good enough to actually do a usable job that way",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:14): I guess it's fairly easy to agree that the spec style is obsolete but the hard thing is either deciding what new style to change to (since a dozen different people will have two dozen different ideas for what the standard should be), or being willing to abandon the whole notion of consistent formatting across specs and letting editors have a lot of flexibility and waiting for conventions to emerge naturally",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:15): a standards body that comes to a standstill when they try to come up with a new standard for their own spec formatting? that'd also be embarrassing :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:15): (The W3C approach seems more like the latter option, so every spec looks a bit different and some look very different)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:16): A standard for spec formatting is like a whole multi-storey complex of bikesheds :-p",
