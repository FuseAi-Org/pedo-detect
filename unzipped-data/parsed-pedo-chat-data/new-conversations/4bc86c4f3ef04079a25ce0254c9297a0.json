        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (16:53): well, you can send an arp who has (or who is, never remember by heart) but not directly a ping (need to look arp cache)",
        "6f43f6b19cf54b5ce90c4e9b2ac42f67 (16:54): hmm, thanks, i never tried that.. but how to send an arp request?",

        "da4d33a374923b308a2846b5e1d74039 (16:55): because that maps from ip to mac",
        "da4d33a374923b308a2846b5e1d74039 (16:55): and you already have the mac :)",

        "7b657a732952c864a91b0feae9cda80c (16:56): why do want to &quot;ping&quot; a machine if you don't know its IP adress in the first place?",
        "da4d33a374923b308a2846b5e1d74039 (16:57): because for one, you could have a fresh machine",

        "7b657a732952c864a91b0feae9cda80c (16:57): then check with your dhcp server logs?",
        "da4d33a374923b308a2846b5e1d74039 (16:58): it might not do dhcp",

        "6f43f6b19cf54b5ce90c4e9b2ac42f67 (17:00): henry54: well, the thing is: the host (which is in fact a sun ray) is located at another subnet and unable to fetch an ip by dhcp from the subnet i am sitting in. i can ping the gateway of the other subnet so i think my routing info is correct, isn't it? i just want to determine why it is not getting an ip, and if it is a routing problem or a misconfiguration in the sun ray server software",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (17:00): DHCP is a local-net thing",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:00): like ARP.. :)",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (17:00): if you want it to cross a router, the router needs to be setup to forward DHCP requests",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (17:01): if you want to check if it's working or not, either use snoop (&quot;snoop port 67 or port 68&quot;) or run dhcpd with the -d option",
        "6f43f6b19cf54b5ce90c4e9b2ac42f67 (17:01): correct",
        "6f43f6b19cf54b5ce90c4e9b2ac42f67 (17:02): the thing is, it already worked while the sun ray server was based on jds linux, so the router seems to be configured well. i migrated to solaris10 this weekend..",
        "7b657a732952c864a91b0feae9cda80c (17:02): yes, or you could check the routers arp table after restarting the SR.",
        "6f43f6b19cf54b5ce90c4e9b2ac42f67 (17:02): btw. i am snooping right now :)",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (17:02): right.  and did you setup the sunray stuff in the DHCP server?",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (17:03): in.dhcpd -d  will give you the best output",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (17:03): you'll need to disable it first tho - svcadm disable -t dhcp-server",
        "6f43f6b19cf54b5ce90c4e9b2ac42f67 (17:07): &lt;Doc&gt; right.  and did you setup the sunray stuff in the DHCP server? &lt;- actually the sun ray server install takes care of it itself, but i've never configured a sun ray interconnect on solaris10, so i'm not sure about this",
        "6f43f6b19cf54b5ce90c4e9b2ac42f67 (17:09): before digging in to the dhcpd-stuff, i'd like to crawl through my snoop-output first. any ideas what to look for?",
