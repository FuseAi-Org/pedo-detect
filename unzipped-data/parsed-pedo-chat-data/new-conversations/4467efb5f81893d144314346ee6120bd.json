At the moment it sounds a bit like the start of a &quot;Doctor Doctor, it hurts when I do this&quot; joke",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:26): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: it lets me do paragraphs, headings and tables",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:26): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: and Nvu wasn't better at that",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:27): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: and getting a Dreamweaver license would be an overkill",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:27): Tables I can somewhat understand, but it seems like for paragraphs + headigns you would be better off with a text editor",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:27): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I disagree",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:27): press return vs. typing all those tags",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:28): Including the effort of later post-processing the output?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:28): yes",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:28): I'm pretty surprised",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:28): (I guess tables also need post processing since they will not have proper headers or anything)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:29): usually edits by hand",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:30): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: tables from OOo do have &lt;th&gt;s",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:30): the problem with tables in that OOo wraps the cell contents in &lt;p&gt;",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:30): and puts style and align all over the place",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:30): In the right places (and in how many scenarios)?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:31): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I'm using OO.o Writer/Web. Are you talking about taking an OO.o Writer doc and exporting to HTML?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:31): the &quot;/Web&quot; part is significant",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:31): uses HTML as the native format",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:32): and exposes semantic elements is the style palette",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:32): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: so I pulled latest htmlparser source and updated my workspace and now trying to build... does ecj have the same command-line options as javac? can I just alias javac to ecj?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:32): this trip to SFO is going to be sweet :/",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:33): Oh, curious. There is no top level menu for it, but you can create a new HTML document which changes the application title",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:33): s/top level menu/application menu item/",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:34): The badness of the OO.org UI never fails to amaze me",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:34): creating a good editor is apparently a pretty hard problem",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:34): also, never ever open an existing HTML doc into OO.o",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:35): would love a good robust web-based editor",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:35): OO.o is write-only",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:35): Totally. That doesn't excuse OO.org for having a lame UI in every respect, not just for creating clean HTML",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:38): Mozilla has made much better recovery progress from having a COM clone, an app-specific crossplatform UI toolkit, an app-specific cross-platform 2D graphics layer and a horrible GUI (Netscape 6 Preview Release) than OO.o",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:40): OO.o has never recovered from the policy of making a pixel-by-pixel clone of Office 95",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:40): (at least I assume it was a policy. It would be remarkable if it happened by accident)",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:55): goes back to making the C++ version of that file compile nicely with GCC and MSVC",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:55): apperently, this area is too tough for 3 compilers"
