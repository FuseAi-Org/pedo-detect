        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:09): Hi.. Im trying to make a twisted/turned cylinder, with identical cross-sections, how do I do this (keep in mind, identical and not deformed slices/cross-sections)",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:11): Do you have a reference of what you're trying to make?",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:18): Nope.. then I wouldnt have to make it :)",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:18): But you understand what a cross-section is?",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:19): Yep",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:20): Lets say you start with a square grid, and i want to make a twisted square sylinder. All cross-sections should be the same shape and size.",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:20): But not the same rotation, correct?",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:21): Yep",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:21): 1) Start with the basic cube that comes up when you start Blender.",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:22): 2) Go into edit mode, then face select mode (as opposed to vertex or edge mode)",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:22): 3) Select the top face of the box, and hit &quot;e&quot; to extrude it",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:22): 4) Drag it up, or by hitting &quot;n&quot; you can enter exactly how high you want to extrude that region",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:23): 5) After you have extruded it the correct height, then hit &quot;r&quot; to rotate that selected face, and again you can use the mouse or &quot;n&quot; to put in exact degrees",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:23): But keep in mind.. I want at least 100 extrusions would be a terrible job..",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:23): 6) Repeat steps 3-5 for however many steps you want",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:23): aaah. That is a bit more of a job then. :)",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:24): How many degrees do you want it to rotate in total?",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:24): How many twists?",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:24): What i was looking for was a way to to this in large scale.. Like get blender to repeat last command or somtn",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:24): Yeah -- you can do it",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:24): But there's more than one way to skin this cat",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:24): Rotation of 120degrees centigrade",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:24): 120 degrees over at least 100 divisions",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:25): Dupliframes could likely do what you're trying to accomplish, but that might be overkill",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:25): Yeah!",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:25): Lemme' try something... since it's less than 180 degrees I wonder if simple subdivision would work...",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:25): Dupliframes!",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:25): Because ive tried making the grid, and I thought i could clothe it afterwards, that was impossible",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:25): clothe?",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:26): Jimmey: Dupliframes is tried. I simply get a grid the shape of my desired object, but I want it to be a solid sylinder",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:26): Then covert the dupliframes' result into an object",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:26): CTRL + SHIFT + N",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:26): Or something",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:27): Jimmey: of course ive done that..",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:27): jimmey: When using dupliframes i got the desired framwork, and I made the dupliframes real.",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:28): Hokie",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:28): hanclinto: clothes.. cover a framework with a sheet, stretch a mesh over it or somtn",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:31): henxan: When making clothes for a mesh, I find it easiest to duplicate the mesh I'm trying to cloth, scale the duplicate a little larger than my original, and trim off the parts I don't want.",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:31): But that's for clothing characters and such -- I don't know if you're trying to do a similar thing",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:32): BTW, the subdivision thing I just tried worked okay, but it gave some deformed cross sections (just shrunk)",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:32): Hanclinto: remember that i start out with only a wireframe, which is the exactly crosssection of the twisted cylinder im trying to make..",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:33): hanclinto: well.. seems like weve discovered about the same thing..",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:33): May I ask what this is for?",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:33): Is it architecture? Or a character model?",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:34): hanclinto: I used autodesk wizard or somtn a couple of years ago, to do a similar thing..",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:34): I'm just trying to picture what you're trying to do. Also, are you trying to make a cylinder or a square tube?",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:34): Ive got an example..",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:35): henxan: Also -- could you elaborate more on why the dupliframes didn't work? Because you sound like you were on the right track -- making the dupliframes real, then joining those meshes together",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (16:35): henxan: I don't imagine that there would be any cross sectional deformation doing that",
        "f7d7770a87560076c893cacadb90e9de (16:35): But how do you join the meshes together?",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (16:36): CTRL + J",
