        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:26): setTooltip()?",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:27): yup",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:27): i didn't even check the docs before writing",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:27): at least i use it succeussfully",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:27): hehe :D",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:27): it wasn't really a question, just a &quot;i wonder&quot;",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:27): does it pop up fast?",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:28): yep",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:28): try it and see",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:28): i could use it as the only way to get information about stuff in the scene. now i have additional &quot;info panes&quot; outside the scene view",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:28): ok",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:29): if you write a nice looking widget which displays the info on the scene, let me please know ;)",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:31): i would also prefer that instead of a simple tooltip *g*",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:40): heh",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:40): do you know it that is possilbe to impliment generally?",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:40): currently i just have some QGroupBox with some labels next to the view",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:41): what is possible?",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:41): a widget which pops up on the scene view to display infos when hover an item",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:41): the tips are a bit too slow to pop up for my taste",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:41): ah",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:42): the only thing i see is to paint on the scene, but thats somehow stupid",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:42): tooltips can contain rich text",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:42): but you can of course track the mouse and when it's inside the boundingRect() of an item, show a QWidget there",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:42): and then again when it moves outside, hide it",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:44): or just trap QEvent::ToolTip",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:46): chakie, at the moment it looks like <a href=\"http://christianb.net/files/qmap10.png\">http://christianb.net/files/qmap10.png</a> . actually that suffice me",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:46): informative",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (21:46): and that's what you want, i guess",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (21:47): yep :)",
        "6c7f91861d6b94b21fe638c4e72ada50 (21:49): I have a problem in which qt will ignore part of my code on an  image plugin but it will not tell me what went wrong",
        "6c7f91861d6b94b21fe638c4e72ada50 (21:49): is there any way to force qt to give me errors on what went wrong?",

        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (22:02): did you have crashes too?",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (22:03): oh yes, but that was caused of wrong use of iterators for next part of path",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (22:03): not due to GV ;)",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (22:04): ah",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (22:05): but the main problem is at the moment the cool animation of bot ;)",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (22:10): chakie, it seems that cpu goes lower &quot;proportional&quot; to the time of running :D maybe all stuff is in memory, i dont know",
