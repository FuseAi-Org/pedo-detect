        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:17): Anyway, the commas solve the problem where I misparsed the first half of the sentence when first reading it",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:24): actually, I think, as currently specced, it fully supports the NSResolver",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:25): the only issue is that our implementation doesn't deal with DOM modifications by the resolver according to the spec, but that's due to the fact that I haven't determined what to do about that yet",
