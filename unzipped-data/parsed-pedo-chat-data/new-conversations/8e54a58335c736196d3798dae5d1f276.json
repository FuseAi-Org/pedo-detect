        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:35): MathML is like SVG, more about rendering (at this stage anyway)",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (00:36): it does have a DOM and a fair-sized API, but I don't think the API is implemented anywhere",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:36): Actually it does seem to have a bit of DOM",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:37): the parenthetical was really the more relevant question",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:38): seems better to not implement it and only do it when actual scenarios come up from authors",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:38): It wasn't really intended as a serious suggestion since MathML implementations are generally rather few and far between",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (00:38): I don't know how critical the MathML WG thinks the DOM aspect is, apart from the rendering",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:39): the problem with both MathML and E4X is that not all the browser vendors agree that it should be implemented at all, which makes it inappropriate for an acid test.",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (00:40): I think there are plenty of stable and well-defined features in SVG that could be in an Acid Test",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:40): Yeah, I tend to agree with that (not that it shouldn't be implemented but that it shouldn't be part of a DOM/script acid test)",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (00:40): and that would put more pressure on MS to implement it",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:41): in light of that statement I wonder about DOM traversal...",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:42): yeah, dom traversal is difficult to justify, but easier to justify than svg at least :-)",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (00:42): this isn't about merit, 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, it's about interoperability",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:42): To be fair SVG already has several implementations",

        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:44): That doesn't make it not a modern browser :-)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:44): so apart from SVG and xml:base W3C doesn't have realistic candidates anymore; data: URIs, URIs, HTTP, and ECMAScript are already in... hmm",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (00:45): I think that Konq has SVG support",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:45): (I'd assume KDE4 Konqueror does SVG, but the latest released version doesn't appear to)",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (00:47): huh... I'll have to research that more... I'd have thought it would align to WebKit more",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (00:50): hmmm... Amaya is still under development, and does support SVG, though not yet &lt;canvas&gt;",
