        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (06:29): ah, fair point about WebSocket.URL",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:48): fundamentally it doesn't work",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:48): but we need _something_",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:48): yeah, seems like",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:50): even documenting it to say &quot;this doesn't work interoperably, but here's what the behavior is in some contexts&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:51): that's the minimum we'll do, yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:51): i was hoping for better though",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:51): (that'll be in the obsolete apis section at some point)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:51): I see",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:51): we definitely do still need some replacement for it that actually works",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:51): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:52): i have a folder with 52 e-mails about it",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:20): but that means that DOM requirements end up reading as:",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:21): which sounds stupid.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:21): I wonder how to address this problem.",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (07:42): that's not an author criteria though",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (07:43): that's just explaining how it works",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (07:53): hmm, cool, HTML5 doesn't create CDATASection nodes for text/html",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:55): well we need something that tells the author how it works, i mean, i can't just remove the UA criteria leaving just the IDL",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:55): or can we?",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (07:59): no, but an introduction section that explains all methods should suffice",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:00): If the UA criteria are accurately expressed by the IDL, seems like the prose could actually be removed.",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (08:01): it might be a lot of work, but both an author and UA section for each IDL would be ideal, I think",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (08:01): with the same pedantic detail as writing versus parsing HTML",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (08:09): In the future, I want to run a benchmark to see if dropping foster-parented stuff on the floor if parent gone would speed up the parser by making tree operation objects smaller by 25%",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (08:16): sounds like it would use less memory",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (08:25): it would say what the effect would of invoking the method or getting/setting an attribute",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (08:29): how else would authors know whether it throws an exception for instance?",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (08:29): and when it would throw, etc.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:36): wording could be &quot;Set the foo attribute to...&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:36): hmm, or does RFC 2119 discourage that?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (08:37): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: is it bad if authors see that a setter must set and a getter must get instead of seeing that a setter sets and a getter gets?",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (08:43): or that document.domain cannot be set to www.example.org after it has been set to example.org",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (09:11): the problem is not visible in the Chrome screenshot, but then Chrome cheats and doesn't do AA",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (09:13): I wonder if the issue could be remedied by multiplying the canvas backing buffer dimensions by an integer, telling canvas to turn AA off upon draw to the backing buffer and then doing a bicubic downsample for display",
