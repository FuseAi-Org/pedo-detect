        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (14:14): so more a case of self-promotion",

        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (14:16): i don't really care either way, it just triggered my spamometer so i thought i'd mention it",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:25): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, OpenSP is the major one, but its use is limited mainly to validators or non-HTML uses",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:30): more than that, SP is the only open-source SGML parse, as far as I know",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:31): So there's little reason why a language that doesn't lend itself to DTD-based validation should support it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:31): well, we should be killing DTD-validation",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:31): at every chance possible",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:32): James Clark himself said as much",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:33): &quot;we need to put a knife in the back of SGML&quot; (or something along those lines)",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:34): some might say that it's fairly absurd that in 2009 the W3C Validator is still doing DTD-based validation",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:34): I agree, but I don't think people who want to support DTDs will",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:34): So a more pragmatic argument might be in order :)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:36): some might say that, seeing as this is the year 2009 (not 1989), people who want to support DTDs should probably not be our highest concern",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (14:37): maybe the rule should be that if you mention the term &quot;DTD&quot; un-ironically, you get knee-capped",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:40): the problem is that DTD based validation has been the only reasonably reliable HTML4 validation method for many years, people have grown accustomed to them",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:42): or should we setup virtualkneecap.com?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:43): I suppose a DOS attack is similar to kneecapping, in online terms",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:55): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2, yes, but there's also the stigma attatched to the DTD as being the only official validation method endorsed by the spec, and alternative validators using different techniques and which didn't strictly adhere to the spec were seen as inferior",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:57): even if their results were more useful in practice, like claiming unimplemented SGML shorthand features were invalid",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (15:00): And of idealism in general :)",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:02): it's ironic that 4 or 5 years ago, I shared the ideals of many who are complaining about HTML5 today. Though I've since been corrupted myself :-)",
