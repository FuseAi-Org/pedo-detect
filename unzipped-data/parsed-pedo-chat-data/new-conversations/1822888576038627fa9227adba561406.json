        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (14:44): hey ! , how can I unselect a face,edge ... after I have already selected several edges ?",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (14:46): hold shift and click on the thing to deselect",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (14:49): it's not always works - is there a specific key to ONLY deselect ?",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (14:51): No..  atleast i have never heard of it.",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (14:52): Tho.. by hitting B once or twice gives you that ring selection tool. With it and by Middle mousebutton  you might be able to just DE-select",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (14:52): MAXDDARK ... try it",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (14:52): I am unable to fill for some reason (I select four vertexes and I click on F and on F+shift and it can't fill a face). how ?",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (14:54): it says &quot;no faces selected to make FGON...why, how ???",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (14:58): how to fill a face ?",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (14:59): I get that sometimes if the vertices are in akward angle relating eachother.",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (14:59): Kinda &quot;non alligned&quot; form",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (14:59): so what am I to do ?",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (15:01): Not sure coz i dont know what kind of mesh you are working on. But try kinda align the vertices so that they CAN form a nice face. For instance if you have one vertice far away from the others. Try get it closer.",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:01): MAXDDARK, I think you have more than 4 verts selected",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:01): MAXDDARK, try to remove doubles before hitting F",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (15:01): Oh.. that too",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (15:02): ok...might be doubbles",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:02): If you have more than 4 verts selected it automaticly tries to make an fgon, in stead of a face... and since there's no face yet, you get that error",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (15:03): what is fgon ?",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:03): fgon = multiple faces acting as if they are only one face",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (15:04): Sounds like a bad idea.",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (15:04): :D",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:04): Normally you'd select several faces that are next to each other, then make them an fgon... but only if they are pretty flat (compared to each other)",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:04): Yeah, I don't recommend it",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:04): it's a nice function though",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (15:04): but what is fgon ? what is does ?",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:06): MAXDDARK, to test... create a plane... subdivide it (w key) then select all verts (a key) and make it fgon (f key)",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (15:07): ok...I have a problem - I do have more then for edges....and I need to create a face..(it's like a box plane).",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (15:07): four",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:07): Or just select one half.. before making fgon.. it won't work with a vert in the middle",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:07): MAXDDARK, You can only make a face with either 3 or 4 verts",
        "a7d25878788813b23fa3b817a3cb0ffe (15:08): So you need to make multiple faces",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (15:18): what are normals ?",
        "299c65574cc8e0763c1b2b1798145581 (15:25): the normalvectors of a face",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (15:27): SO WHAT DOES IT MEANS RECALCULATE NORMALS ?",
        "5bb710b3957b0a2788bf46f70c17c233 (15:28): you need them for lighting in say open gl",
