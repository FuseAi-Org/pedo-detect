        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (23:16): I don't think it's a goal of the WG to produce an official tutorial",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (23:17): it's sort of a goal of mine... I wonder if I'm abusing my position or if it's in the charter...",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (23:19): nope; doesn't seem to be in the charter.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (23:20): I'd be fine with things like a primer btw, but I'd love for everyone to not just copy what the W3C say and make up their own mind within the constraints given by the spec",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:21): there seem to be a decent number of people within the WG wanting to write one, though",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (23:22): I've yet to see a person to actually do it",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (23:22): actually, someone did start",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (23:22): really? what did I miss?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (23:22): but it's very basic: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Example_simple",

        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (23:25): once I saw a tutorial that started with a plain text file... a news article, as I recall... and showed how to add HTML markup. I like that structure",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:26): I've always liked Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby &lt;http://poignantguide.net/&gt;",

        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (23:45): but most of all i'd just like to be bouncing ideas off someone regarding a tutorial (if we're to have one) rather than ... well whatever the discussion on tutorials has been so far",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (23:48): http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Jun/0283.html (and further on that thread) give my comments",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:03): Improved maybe?",
