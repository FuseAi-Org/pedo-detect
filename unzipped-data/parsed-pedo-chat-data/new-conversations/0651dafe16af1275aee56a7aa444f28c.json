        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (16:40): The issue is how to create these sets",

        "15acf9951f4c900b4605265783e17a5d (16:44): With publicly available sets, the burden of determining the set is pretty much off the entity that is doing the analysis. Any other set requires a lot of extra legwork, both in getting and describing the additional URLs, examining its bias. Not to say that publicly available sets don't have bias, it is just that they are more easily documented.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:45): can someone quickly tell me whether the character that e.g. &amp;euml; represents can have multiple Unicode representations?",

        "15acf9951f4c900b4605265783e17a5d (16:56): So, is there a way to use available URL sets that is both reproduceable and has the ability to improve the set in ways that are statistically meaningful?",

        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (16:59): an URL set is &quot;biological&quot;. It changes in time, because of the nature of the Web. So for example to compare the results of two different tools, we need a downloaded dated set of URIs and their content (and metadata going with it)",

        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (17:01): Then there is the quality of the set\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 and here same kind of issues than in astrophysics when I was doing star fields research. At a point you have to select the stars, because if you pick up randomly, you get many interesting stats, but not really usable in a scientific way",
        "15acf9951f4c900b4605265783e17a5d (17:02): What if you balance it between selected and random?",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (17:02): I guess the balanced set helps you to test the quality of the random",
