        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:23): He linked http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0020.txt",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:25): Sigh.  Okay, the fancy ascii table formatting is pretty, but really, what's the point of doing something where you have to split up the hexits when you can just do a simple two-column table?  A split 2col table could be equally compact, or likely more compact actually.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:25): Silly people from 40 years ago.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:26): Or I guess 10 years ago, maybe?  When it was put into the archives?",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:32): Well, it's an official-looking and seemingly complete ASCII ref.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:34): More official-looking.  Otherwise, no, because it lacks the unicode mapping.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (19:35): I suspect it's actually less official",
