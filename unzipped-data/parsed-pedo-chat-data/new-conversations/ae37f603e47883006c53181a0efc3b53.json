        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:41): erm i dunno anything specific but they are really big",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (23:41): sure, they need to be big.",
        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:43): i have no idea how capacitors are rated",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (23:44): measured in Farad",
        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:44): what does that mean?",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (23:44): it is the measurement for capacity",

        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:46): so like",
        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:46): big farads = high voltage?",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (23:47): No. check wikipedia, read the article on farad and on capacity.",
        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (23:47): A capacitor has a value of one farad when one coulomb of stored charge causes a potential difference of one volt across its terminals.",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (23:48): Make sure you understand what this means.",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (23:53): Be sure you know how hight the voltage shall be, and how &quot;much energy&quot; you want to store, so how much F the capactior should have and buy one",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (23:53): where is the problem??",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:05): Well, use a heating or similar, IF it is only a small static you need grounding for.",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:05): or use the actual grounding provided by your wall outlet, make sure you know what you do, and which is which :-)",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:08): No, it wouldnt, because the &quot;border officials&quot; will still be able to use whatever is on that passport",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:08): and if i am in the next car and have certain equipment with me, i can read that too then.",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:09): So better just destroy it, it isnt needed anyway. if you fold the antenna back and forth for one hour you're done also.",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:10): Theory, yes. but you will need to get it out there everytime you are checked.",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:12): Okay. What does that help you? Dont you ever want to leave the country or go by plane?",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:13): I dont think so, and if you ever were in an airport there are lines of people, and while you are checked, i can be behind you reading the rfid-tag because the officer said take the passport out.",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (00:14): I then go my equipment in a briefcase or so, and when you passed the control, i simply turn around and go",

        "ad4599b85caeb58a9c0d611527c4a1d2 (00:16): more safe then not having a tag",
