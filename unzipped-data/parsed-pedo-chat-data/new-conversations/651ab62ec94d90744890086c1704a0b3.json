I'm tracerouting my isp's network because I'm bored. the traceroute marches through my two-hop private IP network and then moves on to another hop, which is a public IP. but right after that, it returns a gateway of IP address 192.168.254.2. I'm confused as to what that private IP is doing in my traceroute? could it be some sort of nasty nat'ing?",
