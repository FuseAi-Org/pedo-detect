        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:14): I suck at sounding motivated to do physics",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:16): Are you motivated to do physics?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:18): Yeah.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:18): Good - that should make it somewhat easier :-)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:18): :)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:18): I still suck at knowing what to write",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:19): I can write stuff that makes me look awesome at comp.sci., but when 1/5th of the places your applying to are comp.sci., that isn't overly relevant",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:19): (the other 4/5th are phys.)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:20): hsivonen: yeah i realised a few weeks ago that making the parser rules normative for a validator might be counter-productive",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:20): hsivonen: it might be that we should change the spec to allow validators to do whatever they like to recover once they hit one error in the parser",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:35): sees that they're using the multicoloured Chrome logo",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:40): f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678: I haven't even installed it, so I can't help :-(",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:43): f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678, on which platform?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:45): woah, the icon they've used for the OSX icon is terrible. The resolution is far too low.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:46): looks like they've just stretched the 32px windows icon",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (00:46): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: debian/linux",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:47): there must be an executable somewhere. It's probably called &quot;chromium&quot; or something like that",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:48): maybe you have to start it from the command line if there's nothing you can double click to launch",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (00:49): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: there is http://www.flickr.com/photos f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678/2860126641/ but I get &quot;cannot execute binary file&quot;. I'll try in the morning after I've sobered up.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:50): f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678, what's the relevance of the flickr photo?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:51): strongly suspects a msipaste",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:52): the OSX version doesn't integrate well with the system",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:52): oh dear, svg 1.2 tiny is back in last call",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:53): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, did it drop back from CR, or progress from WD?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (00:53): So there's tiny and basic, who implements full?",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (00:54): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: oh crap, wrong link. i meant: /opt/cxchromium/support/chromium/drive_c/chromium/chrome.exe /me goes to sleep now",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:56): well, that would be the windows executable. I'm guessing you need to use Wine to launch it somehow, though I've no idea how that works",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:57): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: progressed from LC, i think",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:57): Running it under crossover seems like a bad way to get a fair first impression. I guess the animation and scrolling suck less on a native build",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:59): it's definitely not good to run on the Mac. It's bad enough being like a windows up, but the integration problems make it largely unusable",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (01:00): Which integration problems in particular?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:00): Expose doesn't work",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:01): scrolling is bad",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (01:02): Yeah the scrolling is abysmal. Oh well, I guess that's a wine bug.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:03): when you drag tabs off the tab bar, it's quite slow and the transparency is buggered up",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:04): if I didn't have Windows in a Virtual machine to run it in, it would be ok, but it's not really worth it, especially since I already have webkit available"
