        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:39): Looking at an Acer, AMD Sempron 3200+, 512MB RAM, nvidia nforce 4 onboard",
        "6cd669041131cb7b15e166c8eefa79da (04:40): Cooner750: i have heard good things about the linux support for the nforce 4",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:40): yeah nforce4 chipsets are great Cooner750, especially if you pair them up with nvidia gpu too ;)",
        "6cd669041131cb7b15e166c8eefa79da (04:41): the rest sounds a tad old, but should be fine for desktop work",
        "6cd669041131cb7b15e166c8eefa79da (04:41): Triffid_Hunter: does not strike me as a gaming setup ;)",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:41): $289 for that machine",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:41): from Circuit City",
        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (04:41): not bad",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:41): Instant rebate, was $509 lol",
        "6cd669041131cb7b15e166c8eefa79da (04:42): no idea about the us, but ineuroland that price is quite ok",
        "6cd669041131cb7b15e166c8eefa79da (04:42): that explains it",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:42): I dont play very many games, but the few I do I'd like for them to run lol",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:42): Cooner750: I wouldn't buy it..",
        "6cd669041131cb7b15e166c8eefa79da (04:42): well, what kind of games?",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:42): it does not tell how much VRAM it has though... most likely 64MB",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:43): Cooner750: not mentioning vram usually means it shares system ram which is a fairly hefty performance hit",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:43): I play, er. let me think GTA Vice City, &amp; San Andreas (er.. well I cant right now, because the HP I have now has really bad VIA graphics), and 18 Wheels of Steel",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:43): Cooner750: what gpu does the box have?",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:44): all it lists is nvidia nforce 4 onboard video",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:45): Cooner750: ah so this whole system is basically a gamble",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:46): It's an Acer Aspire Desktop PC (T160-US321H)",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:47): that's pretty much why I wouldn't buy it.. if i'm gonna shell out for a machine, it's gonna be the best I can put together, not some nice numbers glued together with bottom of the barrel parts",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:47): decision is ultimately yours though :)",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:48): I think bottom of the barrel parts computers are emachines",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:48): I've got an older one upstairs that I've had non-stop issues with",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:49): Cooner750: so buy parts and build a system.. it'll love you for the effort unless you let the smoke out ;)",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:50): i did think about building a 3.2Ghz Celeron D system w/ 512MB memory and SiS onboard graphics for $329",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:52): tigerdirect.com has an Abit MicroATX motherboard including the 3.2Ghz Celeron D for $80",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:52): I recommend staying away from onboard graphics altogether",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:52): minus heatsink and fan",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:52): an nvidia fx5200 is like $30 and will happily run many recent(ish) games until you can afford better",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:53): i have an FX5500 256MB AGP in what used to be my HP at home",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:53): Cooner750: I doubt the HP allowed it to run at its capability..",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:53): AGP 8x",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:54): However it puts stress on the stock PSU",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:54): lol that's poor design",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:54): 250W",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:54): My aunt's HP here that I'm using now has the same case as the HP at home",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:54): Same PSU too",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:55): They both have AMD processors, this one is an Athlon XP 2.2Ghz, but it has an extra 4 pin connector plugged into the motherboard next to the CPU. I thought that was for P4's only?",
        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (04:55): hehe Triffid_Hunter",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:56): Cooner750: it's for extra power independent of processor actually, but intel are the ones that required boards and psus to have it initially",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:56): hence the branding and subsequent association",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:56): Ok, I was wondering what that was for..",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:56): yellow/black wires on it",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:57): yellow is 12v, black is ground",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:57): and red is 5?",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:57): yep",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:58): I've never built a computer, but I've had old ones taken all the way down to having the motherboard off of the tray",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:58): -5, -12 and power-good change between supplies, but PS-ON is always green and 3.3v is always orange",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (04:58): Cooner750: cases are optional.. as long as the electricity gets where it needs to be, machine works ;)",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (04:59): Funny that you mention that, because my Smoothwall internet server is an old P2 233 board in a box :P",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:00): 2 NICs, a 1.6GB Caviar HD, and an old Sparkle brand PSU",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:00): ZIF P2",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:00): yep i made a 386dx33/16mb smoothwall box for some friends, and it's had uptimes of many months just sitting in a shoebox routing packets",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:00): This one used to be sitting just out on the shelf it's on, but the drywall on the wall behind it is crumbling and fell all over the motherboard and processor",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:01): so I put it in an old box",
        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (05:05): lmao nice Triffid_Hunter",
        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (05:05): my server is an old gateway PII",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (05:05): PS_ON is not always green; it can be grey, and there is no specific colour stipulated in the specification. As for -5V, it's not required by the current version of the ATX spec.",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:06): Xbit-MTX: you've seen grey PS-ON? *mental note*",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (05:09): Yep. Seems to me any colour as long as it's not ambiguous with the other lines is acceptable under the specification.",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:13): Speaking of PS-ON, how can you 'hotwire' an ATX supply to turn on without a motherboard to signal it?",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:13): Cooner750: short green (PS-ON) and black (GND)",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:14): powerup is indicated by the fan unless you have one of the types which only turn on the fan at a certain temp",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:14): Does that have to be momentary or do they have to be connected together to keep it running?",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:14): it turns off when you disconnect",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:15): So I could just put a switch on that...",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (05:15): PS_ON must be pulled low the whole time you need power.",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:15): ok, too bad I dont have any ATX supply to test it on lol",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:15): i just have the AT style ones, with the on/off pushbutton switch that has mains voltage at it.",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:18): What are these power supplies like my emachine has on it? The ones that appear to have no fan on the back of them, just a grille, and then a fan on the bottom of it inside?",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (05:18): They're known as HTX, I believe.",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:19): Cooner750: the power supplies' fan is mostly to suck air out of the top of your case, and only partially to cool the supply itself",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:19): so as long as there's a bit of airflow, it'll be fine",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:19): there is, you can feel hot air blowing out of the back of it",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (05:19): The most important is keeping the electolytic caps below 70 degrees, otherwise they derate quickly and are generally not rated above 85.",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:19): so they've just set up the case so one fan can do the work of two or three",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:20): it has one of those plastic duct things that turns 90 degrees to the back of the case and pulls air in directly to the processor",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:20): Cooner750: yeah I made my own ones of those for my cpu and gpu",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:20): one's made of cardboard and tape, the other was a chocolate milk bottle",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:20): I've done that, with my Powerspec",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:21): with plastic bottles",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:21): dropped temps 12 degrees",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:21): top blowhole is good too",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:22): as is putting primary hard drive where the floppy drive would go if people still used them so it can get lots of nice outside air over it",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:22): the back of the emachine has 2 holes diagonally from each other where the plastic duct is, where it looks like a fan could be mounted",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:23): yeah probably for when they want a faster proc in the same chassis",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:24): i have a slot fan in it right now, in the very top slot",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:24): I think it's the Antec Cyclone",
        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (05:24): i'd love a top blowhole",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:24): the front of my older Powerspec (1Ghz PIII) has to be lifted up a little with something to allow air to enter the case",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:25): Storkme: my case came with one :)",
        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (05:25): nice",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:26): For a while I had the extra 5 1/4&quot; bay cover knocked out and I built a cardboard/plastic duct that ran to the processor, so it pulled air in from the front of the case. The problem with it pulling air from the back is it tends to pull the hot air coming out of the PSU back inside the case",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:27): It did suck in a lot of dust for some reason though that way",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:27): But the A/C unit blew right on the front of the computer so it stayed cool very good",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:29): i need to do that with my emachine",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (05:29): Cooner750: sounds like you're adept at hardware mods.. i'm surprised you haven't built your own machine yet",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:31): I havent because I dont have the money lol",
        "31457306d59c90b2794460f1dff84aa3 (05:32): brb",
        "c7ed2767ee0fa219d78a36197fbd0789 (05:33): The single PSU fan setup in this emachine does not work well, I have the extra drive cover out and it does not pull any air in"
