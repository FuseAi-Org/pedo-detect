        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:40): So it's not a big deal in the scheme of things.",
        "da5121879fff54b08b69ec54d9ac2bf6 (01:40): The growth of the value of the company is usually sufficient.",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (01:40): unless someone buys them up, changes the rules and syphons off money, seen that all too often",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:41): Right, and dividends slow down the company's growth sometimes.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:41): 5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0, hostile takeovers of that sort are very rare.  A publicly-traded company almost always has far higher market capitalization than assets.  Usually when you have that sort of systematic buy-out, it's an attempt to merge one company into a larger one or such.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:42): But it's hard to pull off, because trying it causes the stock price to shoot up.",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (01:42): &lt 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762&gt; It's simpler than that, it's just that large businesses are powerful enough to have bargaining power with the government. &lt;- that's one aspect, but not the only one. just look at all the externalties that companies cause and that the taxpayer has to wipe up after them",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:42): Anyway, if you do buy a lot of stock in the company, it's rarely in your interest to try grabbing the assets and running.  You want to hold onto the stock and let it go up in price, then sell it.  That almost always provides better returns.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:43): Except if the company's stock price has really crashed, then it's sometimes worthwhile to buy it just for the sake of liquidating it.",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (01:43): oh, you don't grab the assets. you slowly bleed money from them, then sell it again while it's still somewhat performing",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:43): 5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0, practically any economic activity causes externalities, both positive and negative.  Big businesses can bring a lot of positive economic effects, like greatly reduced costs through economy of scale.",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (01:44): i'm talking about negative externalties, obviously.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:44): They can devote a much larger amount of their budget to R&amp;D and innovation, etc.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (01:44): Well, yes, but you can't fairly complain about the negative externalities unless you have evidence that they outweigh the positive externalities.",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (01:44): which sometimes exceed even the profit that the companies themselves make (look at nuclear fuel processing and waste storage cycles)",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (01:45): it's basically cheap power for the economy in exchange for the govt funding the whole infrastructure and waste management for millions of years to come.",
        "da5121879fff54b08b69ec54d9ac2bf6 (01:47): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: Sure you can. I spend all day searching for an complaining about the few negative issues in otherweise good software. I don't see why the management of this planet's productive resources should be exempt from any criticism. Quite the contrary.",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (01:51): you could go even further... we're putting some of those negative externalties on those who don't see anything of the positive ones (i.e. everything that isn't human)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (02:09): can browsers implement rel=noreferrer already so &quot;anonymous link&quot; sites can die horribly",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (02:10): uhm... you know... you could just block cross domain referrers",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (02:11): uhm, that wouldn't magically make sites using anonymous link proxies stop doing so",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (02:11): i have GM scripts to undo some of them, but i shouldn't have to, and it doesn't work for all of them (not all of them encode the real URL as a query parameter)",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (02:11): if that's your issue... there are addons that clean up the urls as long as the actual target is embedded in the link",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (02:12): anyway, noreferrer only solves half of the problem. just look at google. they're linkjacking their own links to track what you've clicked on.",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (02:13): that's a separate (and roughly equally disgusting) problem",
        "5cfdf2d621b2a11df72a2e70bd2ff1a0 (02:13): it's not just the target sites that harvest data. it's the source sites too"
