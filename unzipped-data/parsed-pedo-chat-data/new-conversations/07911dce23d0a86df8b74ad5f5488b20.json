        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:48): You should be able to, yeah.",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:48): ahigerd: I get a LD segmentation fault.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:48): Odd.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:48): Sure the library is valid?",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:49): ahigerd: Should the dll .h be aded to HEADERS or simply using it as #include in the code will work?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:49): As #include is sufficient; after all, QtCore4.dll is a standard dll file",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:49): And you don't HEADERS += qapplication.h",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:49): indeed",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:49): How can I verify the validity of the .dll file?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:49): I've linked to libcrypt.so on Linux before; I'm not sure why it wouldn't work on Windows.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:50): Got anything else linking to it?",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:51): ahigerd: Basically, I am cross-compiling with MinGW on Ubuntu with Qt 4.2. I succeeded in creating the .dll file, but when I try to compile the application linking to it, i got this strange LD segmentation fault.",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:52): ahigerd: So I looked on the Qt Forum about it. I found a topic (<a href=\"http://www.qtforum.org/article/17176/Link-with-a-external-DLL.html\">http://www.qtforum.org/article/17176/Link-with-a-external-DLL.html</a>) stipulating I need a .a file instead of .dll file.",

        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:52): oh",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:52): That is not what I want.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:52): MinGW static library, at that",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:53): Maybe it's not actually a static library",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:54): ahigerd: Now, just to be certain, how would you write in the .pro file that you want to link to a .dll ?",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:55): ahigerd: I use:     LIBS += -L&quot;../../../some/path&quot; -lmylib",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:55): Yes.",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:55): So that is the way it should be.",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:56): Is there a way to verify that my .dll file is not corrupted or something?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:56): Now, there are some other conflicts I've seen with DLL files (i.e. MySQL)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:56): Um... like I said, got something else that can link to it? Maybe something built with MSVC?",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:57): Dynamically link you mean?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (02:58): Yeah",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (02:58): I could try that.",

        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:00): Should I try explicit or implicit linking?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:00): ?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:01): Not familiar with the difference",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:01): ahigerd: Implicit linking is what I am using right now. That is: using the objects contained in the library as if it was compiled along the application. Explicit would be to use QLibrary objects.",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:05): ahigerd: So, do you use QLibrary objects?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:05): Yeah",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:06): But I'm on Linux, and it seems to work flawlessly with standard .so files",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:06): Indeed it works fine.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:06): I've done both forms of linking -- I linked with libcrypt implicitly and my own plugins explicitly. (That sounds backwards...)",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:07): But cross-compiling for windows is making me seasick.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:07): And as far as I know, implicit linking of Qt-built DLLs under Windows works fine.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:07): As long as they're built the same way.",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:08): I'm at the point of considering building it natively on Windows.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:08): I'd recommend it.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:08): Even if it's just in a VM",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:09): Exactly what I was thinking.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:09): Last I knew WINE doesn't run under Cygwin, but I've never checked virtualizing the other direction.",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:09): I think it's worth a try.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:09): Indeed.",

        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:09): Can't see why it WOULDN'T work if you provide it with the real Windows DLLs.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:10): For reference, not for execution",
        "dc54cbff49eb46541e5e869bbb30c032 (03:10): yeah, well",

        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:10): It might work without since WINE does a pretty good job of interpreting...",
