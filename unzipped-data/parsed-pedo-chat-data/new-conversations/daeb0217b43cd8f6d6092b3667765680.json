        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (00:07): tried calling them",

        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (00:08): then again, the minute they decided to play the reseller game and bullshit the medium sized wisps wanting to order 100 packs, was the minute ubnt proved they're stupid.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (00:09): oh well, I think the problem is the SR9 is a 2.4 converter and nobody wants to admit it.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (00:09): (which would mean 2.4 crosstalk would affect the performance of the card)",
