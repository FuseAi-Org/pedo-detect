        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:09): why dont you create a user call maybe ftpuser",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:09): and then create a samba user named maybe ftpuser",
        "d48bbf16d977c0a61e1b2c52890de6fa (08:10): well, I wanted anon first, then I will work on security",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:10): then grant access to  your share to user ftpusr",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:11): hmm..",
        "d48bbf16d977c0a61e1b2c52890de6fa (08:11): I have a user setup, though it was doing the same thing, so I was eliminating probable causes, thought. keep security,etc out till I get this ironed out",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:11): if you grant access to anon any user from 10.0.0.65 will have access..",
        "d48bbf16d977c0a61e1b2c52890de6fa (08:11): what do you mean",

        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:12): well any user that logs in to the machine 10.0.0.65 will have the access you grant...",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:12): ok",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:12): so",
        "d48bbf16d977c0a61e1b2c52890de6fa (08:13): funny thing, I actually had this up, decided to give FC5 a try (Away from Debian)... I had the user setup and everything",
        "d48bbf16d977c0a61e1b2c52890de6fa (08:13): I wanted the practice in configuring Samba since I just learned it... so I didn't bother backing up my conf file",
        "d48bbf16d977c0a61e1b2c52890de6fa (08:14): Now I'm paying for not leaving myself a reference, but I didn't have an issue the first time, so I wasn't expecting there to be an issue",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:15): ok the easiest will be to set security = share",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:15): the minor will be map bad user = guest or nobody",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:16): the kind of hard will be creating users and applying share permissions",
        "67cee08719d69b5b4ffd4c3e4afdabb9 (08:16): and all this info is on the samba how to collection and samba 3 by example... :)",
        "d48bbf16d977c0a61e1b2c52890de6fa (08:17): with security = user, does that mean guest = ok does nothing?",
