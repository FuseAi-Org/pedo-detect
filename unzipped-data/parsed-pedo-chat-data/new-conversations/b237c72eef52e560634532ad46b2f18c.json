        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (21:12): apparently some people think it means the former",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:15): It already says &quot;consider adopting it&quot; which sounds distinct enough from 'always adopt it' and still allows room for thinking",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (21:16): yeah, we need to do some serious PR work this week to address the misunderstandings and fears people have about such things",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:16): are we allowed to talk here?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:16): (Incidentally, http://www.archive.org/details/whiffsfromwildme00fossiala has the original copy of the poem - it seems to have been mutated quite a bit in its journey around the web, at least in terms of formatting)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (21:16): yup, just not on the mailing list (i think) :)",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:24): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: it was really meant to be more about practices that are orthogonal to existing standards rather than contrary ones, although there is a bit of each",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (21:43): 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884: yeah, i'm just noticing that some of them are causing FUD",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:45): Pave The Cowpaths really should be about paving the cowpaths when something is paved at all -- i.e. given a requirement, satisfy it by enshrining what authors do instead of inventing something new that they have to learn.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:46): or maybe it should be about adding features based on what authors do, rather than on what we think they do",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:47): basically, it's either &quot;class=&quot;footer&quot; is used, so we should enshrine it&quot; or &quot;class=&quot;footer&quot; is used, so we should have &lt;footer&gt;&quot;",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (21:47): &lt;footer&gt; is the safer alternative, given the recent debate about predefined classes",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:49): (on the mailing list)",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:49): he also put the design principles on indefinite hold, even though both designated reviewers came back with a mostly positive evaluation",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:50): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: it's meant to be the former (and at &quot;consider&quot; level, so could be outweighed by other technical issues), but we should also have something about the latter",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:51): 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884: would be interesting to have more examples from the spec than just &lt;br/&gt;",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:51): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: predefined classes would be an example, though likely a controversial one",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:51): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:52): predefined classes are an argument against this principle",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:53): well, they are subject to your &quot;given a requirement&quot; proviso",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:53): I'm not sure what requirement, if any, the current predefined classes satisfy",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:54): the only thing i actually cared about was class=copyright, and we can deal with that use case with &lt;small&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:54): oh! &lt;small&gt; is a pave-the-cowpaths",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:54): good point",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:54): duh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:54): shoulda thought of that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:54): wait, i did",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:54): nevermind",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:54): moving right along",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:55): so yeah. the other classes in the spec now are handled by &lt;aside&gt;, mostly",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:55): and i think that's all _i_ need from the point of view of writing the spec",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:55): (e.g. making examples and notes &lt;aside&gt;s)",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (21:55): I like &lt;small&gt; better than class=&quot;copyright&quot;, as it is more general and the actual copyright notice can be identified through trivial textual analysis so class=&quot;copyright&quot; doesn't help much",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:55): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:56): class=&quot;copyright&quot; as far as i can tell is just used for making small fonts, too",
        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (22:01): making fonts small, not making small fonts ;)",

        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (22:08): does that include be-x-old ?",
        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (22:09): which apparently has 7000 wikipedia articles: http://be-x-old.wikipedia.org/",
