        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:01): well, for a page like, say, the google results page, gzip can only compress the page, whereas this can compress the header and footer parts dramatically",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:02): I see a slide deck, guess I will look at that",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:03): having a per-site compression index does carry some risks",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:03): but it also sounds in theory like it could be a big win",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:03): Also it'd be interesting to compare to gzip with a preset dictionary",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:03): true, a preset dictionary for the general web including common html and css constructs might be a big win too",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (02:04): this could subsume that if you allow Access-Controls on dictionaries",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:05): and btw I am specifically interested in perf on a large variety of realistic examples, not just the best-case examples",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:05): (or else convincing argument that best case is very common)",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (02:05): search pages are pretty common",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:05): Maybe we could just hardcode Google's header and footer into all UAs",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (02:05): but yeah",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:06): I would hope it is more broadly applicable than google search result pages",
