        "6f16cd9a6e67276e66575e766d3d2021 (07:13): so while I declare the classes in .h files and put the code in .cpp files Ishould have no problem, right?",

        "7fb20b110471e7292ea9ee8481ff5804 (07:19): The reason why you usually don't need to #include the moc files is that qmake implicitly generates rules to do it for you, so cmake needs to know how to do that too.",

I would like to change the backgrounds of the QLabels (individually, and dynamically) during execution. What's the best way to do this--I'm under the impression that if I start out using stylesheets then I must continue with it, so setStyleSheet?",
