        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (00:04): point 2: How many of those people are cogniscent of the Gregorian/Julian calendar issues?",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:09): and then we won't be sure whether he even existed, or was just a fiction created by the WHATWG cabal",

        "041f18d4e2e27cd97f4404c2c67cb362 (00:14): floating point just to be sure and present time because it simplifies calculations because the current time is always 0.0",
