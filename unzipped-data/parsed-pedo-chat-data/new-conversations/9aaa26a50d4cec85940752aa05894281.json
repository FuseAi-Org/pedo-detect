        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:21): 14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642, we've yet to figure out styling form controls unfortunately",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:22): though what WebKit is doing for controls in combination with appearance and all seems quite nice, but nobody has written down all the details in a specification yet...",
        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (12:22): hmm so that spec is yet to be written...",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:23): pretty much",
        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (12:23): how one start writing such spec",
        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (12:23): where ever I give html5 demo, all designers ask this question",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:23): usually by figuring out the fundamentals",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:24): e.g. how does form styling currently work across various platforms, what is the effect of setting various properties, etc.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:24): then figuring out how appearance affects that, what pseudo-classes are supported, how they all work together",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:25): and while testing all that writing down implementation criteria for someone that tries to emulate it",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:25): once we know the fundamentals we can start poking holes and enable new stuff",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:25): that's pretty much how we're doing most new features that are somewhat based on old APIs",
        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (12:26): ok",
        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (12:26): that will mean we have to add new css controls or attributes ?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:27): maybe",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:27): another idea is that appearance:none would disable all styling and you would create the entire control yourself using XBL",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:28): though we'd need some hooks from XBL into the form API to make that completely feasible",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:28): e.g. so you can declare a form control matches :out-of-range and things like that",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:29): anyway, as things stand today CSS is not defined for form controls",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:29): the CSS WG declared it out of scope and nobody volunteered to fix it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:32): XBL2 will save us",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:39): But who will save us from XBL2?",
        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (12:40): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e, while leaving other form controls is fine, but styling of calender and time control is very important",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:01): any time I've ever shown a demo of the WF2 input calendar, one of the very first questions is always about whether the style can be changed",

        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (13:02): I think its time to write a specification for this.",

        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (13:03): I am confused should this be a separate spec or should we add to an existing HTML5 spec",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:03): separate spec",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:04): I'm not myself convinced it's so important to end users",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:04): I do realize that some designers believe it's importan",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:05): the alternative for designers who do is just to keep doing whatever they're doing now to provide calendar widgets in their content",
        "14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642 (13:09): not to end users but to designers, it is. Like font-face in css",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:13): 14aa6d9c68065801e7d81ccb889de642: well, I think users do actually benefit a lot more from the effects of font-face than they would of calendar-widget styling",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:15): 29807224782917c753c1fe2a43b79fb1: is this a test?",
