        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:20): mailing you and WG about it right now",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:21): okay",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:21): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: your current online public tests about MQ are light, do you have any plans to provide the WG with a complete suite of tests ?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:22): and how long do you think it will take ?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:23): do you have specific suggestions for new tests?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:23): you don't test all features",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:23): only width",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:23): I agree more is needed btw, but ideas are welcome",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:23): you test oly lengths",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:23): only",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:23): oh right, well, if you figure out a plan to test the rest in some reliable fashion let me know :)",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:24): wait",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:24): so you say this is untestable ?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:24): http://tc.labs.opera.com/mediaqueries/",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:25): that's not what I meant",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:25): so we need tests :)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:25): I'm saying they're hard to test",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:25): because all the non-dimension things depend on platforms and such",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:25): absolutely",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:26): e.g. color-index and color",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:26): but if we don't have tests, these features will not go to PR and since they're not listed as at-risk, the whole spec won't go to PR",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (17:26): Glazou, I'm in another telcon now, but will send minutes in an hour or so.",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:26): thanks bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:26): I suppose I can state that you need to test browsers on a specific MacBook or something",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:26): then the test suite can simply assume that as reference platform",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:27): oh I even suppose some features will require a mobile device with a screen of shades of gray",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:27): that's not a problem",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:28): right ok",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:28): ok",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:28): the current tests work for most platforms though so I'd like to extend these first",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:28): thanks",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:28): to cover more parse errors mostly",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:28): as I said, we need a whole Test Suite anyway",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:28): then i can probably create a directory with feature tests",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:28): or this doc will not exit CR",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:28): I know how the W3C operates",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:29): I know you know :)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:29): and what I wrote as exit criteria ;)",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:29): and I know you don't always like it :)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:29): heh",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:30): i agree we need to test all the features though",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:31): though I think two similar implementations (e.g. Opera and Firefox) on a single reference platform (e.g. a 13in MacBook) should suffice",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:31): no need to find two implementations on a monochrome mobile device as well :)",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:31): well",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:31): if you want to test color depth",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:32): or 'monochrome'",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:32): you'll need such a device",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:32): you've got mail :)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:32): I don't see how you would test interoperability with such a mobile device",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:33): how do you know the software is the same?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:33): can't you change color settings on a MacBook and then check if the browser updates stuff or not?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:33): that will be enough yes",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:35): saying that the CR period ends in October, what does that mean?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:36): it's still a CR right if we haven't finished stuff by then?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:43): it means that there is high expectation from the both W3C and the public on this spec and the Director wants a deadline",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:43): what's the consequence?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:44): I don't really know, probably that another CR will be needed if we miss the mark ; but if we miss the mark, we will loose all credibility in the consortium anyway",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:44): we have 6 months to write a few tests and 3 implementation reports",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:44): that should be doable, right ?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:45): I mean unless Opera/Apple/Mozilla don't want MQ to move to PR",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:45): specs are not only the document",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:45): it's also the test suite",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:45): I'm pretty certain we'll hit a bunch of bugs and the question is whether implementations will have time to fix the bugs on time",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:45): then we'll move back to WD",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:46): if the spec is fine but the impl haven't had time to catch up yet?",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:46): we cannot say that all the time ; at some point, you must say ok, we move forward",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:46): then we don't have interoperability and can't mvoe out of CR",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:46): but the CR has a &quot;deadline&quot;",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:46): oh well",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:46): yes",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:47): I don't understand the reason for a meaningless deadline, but I don't really care",
        "72af1cb61d47fcc5d18402bf3d1c147d (17:47): e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0, you have to understand the W3C staff really questions ability of browser vendors in the CSS WG to make specs move forward because at some point, the commitment decreases",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:48): I don't think we can solve that with deadlines",
