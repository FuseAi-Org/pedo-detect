        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (14:58): So if this is supposed to become an IETF thing, the people working on it should have their discussion there.",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (15:00): &quot;Informational RFC&quot; is the same as a W3C Note, right?",

        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (15:05): Because it matters to the IETF, and to the WG-to-be. The point of forming a WG is to produce standards track documents here.",

        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (15:07): And, of course, one of the reasons why process *does* matter is IPR.",

        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (15:09): But just because they do not prevent it doesn't mean it's a good thing when people of significance to the spec development do that outside the process",

        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (15:12): what I said is that if people who are important for the contents of the spec do not want to do that on the WG's mailing list, that will be a problem.",
        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (15:12): the simplest way to fix this is to encourage them to join the mailing list.",

        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (15:13): If the spec is known to be developed somewhere else, it would be a reason not to treat it as if developed by the WG, and then it would be harder to put it onto the standards track.",
        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (15:15): how about addressing the issue, by agreeing that, *if* there'll be a WG, and *if* that WG wants to work on that spec, discussion should move to the WG's mailing list?",
