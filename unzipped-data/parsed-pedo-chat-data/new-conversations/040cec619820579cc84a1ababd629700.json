When an image is explicitly marked as being critical content, there should be a much better chance that it actually is critical content. That can set the initial bias for any heuristics when the UA is trying to decide how to present the image to the user",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:02): i'm surprised as to your initial assertion",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:02): is that really true?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:02): (The heuristics might be as simple as &quot;if it's got no alt, it's probably decorative, so ignore it&quot; and &quot;if it's marked as important, say &quot;image, press enter for more information&quot;&quot;)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:03): I haven't looked at any relevant statistics from current content so I don't really know :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): ah ok",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:03): (Or the heuristics might be some futuristic image analysis thing with a Bayesian classifier or whatever it is)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): my guess would be that it isn't true",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): and that there is no corrolation between lack of alt text and importance of image",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:03): I suspect that images with missing alt show the same statistical distribution of decorative or non-decorative as images that do have alt",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): right, what maciej said",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:04): If you count the spacer and background images in http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/imgs.xhtml then there's quite a lot of decorative ones",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:05): but it'd be easy for a UA to just ignore all files called spacer.gif",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:05): &quot;quite a lot&quot; isn't very scientific, since I haven't bothered actually counting :-p",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:05): most images are spacer gifs according to my surveys",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:05): but they don't all have names like spacer.gif",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:07): anyway",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:07): you can tell if an image is a spacer gif quite easily",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:07): it'll be 100% transparent",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:07): so that can be one of the heuristics the spec talks about",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (03:08): I'd imagine some people use spacers that are the same color as the background, too?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:08): my point is that i don't see that lack of alt text is any more of a legacy problem we face than is bad alt text",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:10): looks",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:12): (er, wc)",
        "a131216c7af242e66537a58b4ca7c9f9 (03:12): 150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64: the heuristic could be &quot;all the same color + opacity&quot;",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (03:12): yeah",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (03:12): that just gets a bit more complicated :)",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (03:12): (to implement)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:13): They're both problems, but it seems easier to solve the first problem (by identifying intentionally-omitted-alt with some new syntax, so authors can make sure their critical images don't get ignored by incorrect heuristics) than the second problem, and partially solving one problem is usually better than solving none (except when solving that problem takes far too much effort to be worthwhile and distracts from other problems :-) )",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:18): it's not clear to me that it is possible to identify intentionally-omitted-alt from lazily-omitted-alt.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:19): (or from ignorantly-included-alt)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:20): because tools tend to mix all three of those up",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:31): It's not possible to identify them if the syntax for both is &lt;img src=...&gt; with no alt, so it'd need other syntax like &lt;img noalt&gt; or &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; or whatever",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:31): i don't understand why the syntax makes things any better",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:31): Then they'd still get mixed up and used wrong, but there should be some (imperfect) correlation between images-marked-as-important (with intentionally omitted alt) and images-which-are-important, so UAs can make more accurate guesses - they still have to guess, but they can guess better than with no extra information, and good authors can help their users by making UAs guess in the right direction",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:31): what will stop people from using &lt;img noalt&gt; to shut up the validator?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:32): i guess i'm not convinced that it would really improve matters that much",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (03:33): I suspect the primary use of @noalt would be to make the validator stop complaining",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:34): in particular, i'm not convinced that if we added an &lt;img noalt&gt; or &lt;img missing-alt&gt; attribute, that well-meaning people would be able to tell the difference between &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; and &lt;img missing-alt&gt; or &lt;img noalt&gt;.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:34): and we would actually end up making it worse -- making images that are critical get explicitly marked as decorative (&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:51): I think the basic model seems sound, I just want to think through some of the details (especially with respect to updating)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:54): but I'll try to write up some comments first",
