        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:01): does anyone know where I can find some easy to follow instructions for accessing W3C's CVS via the command line, so I can check specs in and out on my mac instead of having to move everything to windows first?",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:13): lachy, *which* CVS are you interested in?",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:13): dev.w3.org or cvs.w3.org?",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:13): or, put differently, the html5 spec, or something else?",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:14): also, do you already have access from Windows (i.e. this is a Mac support question), or do you not have access at all so far (i.e., this is an access rights question)?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:16): 8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393, the stuff on dev.w3.org. In particular, Selectors API and the HTML5 authoring guide",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:16): do you have access from Windows already?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:16): yes",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:16): I use TortoiseCVS",

        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:17): do you have the ssh key that you use from Windows on the Mac?",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:17): (the private key, that is)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:18): yes, I put my private key in ~/.ssh/identity",

        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:19): ... should check out the html5 repository",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:19): inside that directory, you can then use cvs update, cvs commit, cvs diff etc",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:19): cvs is installed by default on macs, I believe",

        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:21): you probably want to set the CVS_RSH environment variable globally",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:21): I already did that",

        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:29): it should invoke an editor for the commit message, and commit all changed files in the current directory",

        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:29): and possibly resolve conflicts manually",
        "8d52bf87a239352ba7cc0aba1035e393 (15:29): but you probably know that routine from Windows",
