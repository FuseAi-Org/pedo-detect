        "5e924aca361e8ab8c27aff487b941903 (21:17): if I want to add html5 fallback for my flash video player, should I add video tag after my flash object tag or before ?",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:18): i believe the flash fallback goes in between the video tags",

        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (22:17): anyone have an opinion on the potential &quot;modern&quot; formatting @ http://www.diveinto.org/html5/modern.index.html ?",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (22:17): The goal will be readability like the whatwg web developer's spec, and be friendly to access from smart phones.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (22:20): 70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 - will there be updates to the contents as well? As HTML5 evolves, I think that's a much bigger concern than &quot;formatting&quot; - that is, such a widely used reference falling out of date with respect to the standards.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (22:21): f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905: that's precisely my goal for the project, and I'm glad you share that concern.  This &quot;modern&quot; design has little to do with that, except to improve the page's accessibility so that it can reach more people on more platforms.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (22:21): Example: http://www.diveinto.org/html5/extensibility.html says &quot;a third option which is part of, and tightly integrated into, HTML5 itself: microdata.&quot; - microdata hasn't been &quot;part of&quot; HTML5 for quite some time - it's a separate specification that works with / on top of HTML, similar to microformats.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (22:22): I'd assume the pages were quite accessible to begin with, given Mark Pilgrim's background/expertise with accessibility (c.f. previous diveintoaccessibility.org and book Dive Into Accessibility) - were there specific accessibility problems you found?",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (22:22): Well, if that language needs to be updated, I would be happy to update it, you could also update it via git and make a merge request.  You could do that all within your browser, in fact.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (22:23): https://github.com/jonathantneal/diveintohtml5/blob/master/extensibility.html and click &quot;Edit this file&quot;",
