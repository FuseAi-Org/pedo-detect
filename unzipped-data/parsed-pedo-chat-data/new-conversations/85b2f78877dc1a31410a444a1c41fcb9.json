        "868ed29f55af5b24e5fa2307cba05860 (01:34): Nothing to talk about.",
        "868ed29f55af5b24e5fa2307cba05860 (01:34): Unless someone asks for help, it's rather quiet in here. :P",
        "5cfdaf29f35dc3b3709f4a0b053e51d0 (01:46): oke thanks. ps there is no airco here. might it be that i've putted to much thermal pound between the cpu and waterblock ?",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (01:47): that won't cause excessive temperatures",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (01:47): 55 is not even all that hot",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (01:47): more radiation = lower temps, of course...",
        "5cfdaf29f35dc3b3709f4a0b053e51d0 (01:50): I just got this cooling it's also my first and after the radiator it is going to the reservoir and then to the cpu should it go first to cpu and then to the reservoir and then the radiator",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (01:52): i dunno, follow the instructions",
        "5cfdaf29f35dc3b3709f4a0b053e51d0 (01:54): these are loose components I bought thinking to add gpu too temp now is 76 in 3d shooter 62 idle lets see what watercooling does next month :)",

        "5cfdaf29f35dc3b3709f4a0b053e51d0 (01:55): 15% overclocked",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:55): well then stop overclocking dumbass",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:55): and the temp will go down",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:55): DUAH",
        "5cfdaf29f35dc3b3709f4a0b053e51d0 (01:56): yeh but it's working still fine",

        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:56): not if it's getting to 55c",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:56): just back off a little",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:56): see if it goes down",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:57): also make sure your cpu fan is running ok and the heatsink is not clogged up",
        "5cfdaf29f35dc3b3709f4a0b053e51d0 (01:57): liquid cooling",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:57): wait",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:57): you already have liquid cooling?",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (01:57): flyback, i know paste spilling onto circuitry can be a problem, but if the sink is well-seated, what other problem is there?",
        "5cfdaf29f35dc3b3709f4a0b053e51d0 (01:57): yes",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:57): wow",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:57): shouldn't be 55c then",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:57): mabye the radiator fan is canucked",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (01:57): or the pump is",
