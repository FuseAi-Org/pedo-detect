        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:09): artb, yeah, we are talking about it in #wam",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:10): for now, I just want to talk about the XHR req and its use in A+E",

        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:11): When I read the req, I think it's OK.",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:11): It doesn't say which spec will satisfy it",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:11): in fact, WebApps may never write a spec that says it will be satisified",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:11): right?",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:12): but some other SDO e.g. OMTP could make a spec",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:13): Regarding this req and section 3.1 of the A+E spec and XHR depdendency, if it said MUST I'd be concerned",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:13): but with the SHOULD, it's not clear there is a problem here",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:13): i.e. why change what is in the spec?",
        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:14): because it puts an API dependency that is not required and that we are not going to fulfill",
        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:14): We should take it out",
        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:15): we have two extremes on the table: 1. include all APIs and Specs and 2. abstract everything (current approach)",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:16): so let me ask this question -&gt; does any part of the A+E spec, as defined in the latest ED (March 26) Require XHR?",
        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:18): Artb, yes, I think it says &quot;a UA must implement XHR&quot;",
        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:18): &quot;In addition to this specification, a user agent SHOULD support the following specifications:",

        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:18): well, it was a &quot;should&quot; not a must",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:19): Yes, I see that but I'm asking if for example any of the methods or attributes require XHR",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:19): If the answer is NO then I agree text you quote above should be deleted",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:19): But deleting the related requirement is a separate issue",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:20): And you wan to delete &quot; * [Widgets-Updates]&quot; too, right?",
        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:21): You are correct, no method in the A&amp;E depends on it. There are methods that depend on [Widget-updates]",

        "dfefdb66581190514404f57cdf74a8eb (17:26): I'll propose it",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (17:26): Why remove the related requirement?",
