        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:41): we're evil!",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (11:41): This is a call to action directed at all standardistas and accessibilitistas.",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (11:41): i was wondering when it was going to start",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:42): but I'm not sure what he's talking about though",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:43): seems like quite a misunderstanding of the WHATWG proposal",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (11:43): i assume different people will cry bloody murder for different reasons",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:43): as John Foliot said, the problem with not knowing history is that you're doomed to repeat it",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:44): (which applies equally well to John Foliot, but he didn't admit that)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:44): (to be fair, I didn't point it out either)",
        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (11:45): I suppose from the mass of emails you could take any point of view on the direction of the wg",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (11:45): not quite, keeping back compat principle holds, no matter what, i reckon.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:46): some people think it should not hold",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:47): Roger Johansson seems to think the WG can somehow mandate browsers to implement UI that indicates errors in pages like iCab does",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:47): that doesn't make much sense to me with at least 99% non-conformance",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (11:50): i think back-compat will hold. simply put, w3c has to do what broswer makers want. all other browser makers have to do what MS want. else, MS moves out, or all browsser makers (MS and others) move out. and this WG basically dissolves.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:51): Well, it's part of the charter, but it's not what people argue for",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (11:52): i think what i said still holds. no MS, no WG. no broswer vendors (MS and others), no group.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:53): WHATWG exists without MS so I'm not really convinced",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:53): (not that MS wasn't invited, btw)",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (11:54): whatwg might keep at it, but that is different from this WG, i think.",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (11:54): would you guys still want a w3c seal if MS leaves?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:00): yeah, I think so",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (12:01): oh, then this WG could continue",

        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (12:03): back-compat is hardwired into the charter, if i'm not wrong, so generic reversal of that is basically out of the question, no matter how many people complain",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (12:03): 6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b: the charter is actually maddeningly vague about the matter",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:03): blames the chairs for not steering enough",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (12:04): 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884, about back-compat? for me, the deciding word is &quot;incremental&quot;",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:04): unless the idea is for this group to remain unproductive, that is",
        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (12:04): i doubt that, e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0. cause of the vision document",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:04): the other thing the charter says is that the new language should define a syntax compatible with popular browser impl",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (12:05): one of our chairs has done exactly 0 chairing",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (12:05): the other has done a moderate amount but seems to move kind of ponderously and with an excessive zeal for perfect consensus",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:05): in a day over two months now",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:06): still no outcome of the vote",
        "69b301143beca31e76cf7bfdbd4d5537 (12:06): I wonder if the &lt;em&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt; thread is petering out?",

        "6ce98a4a7b6e097946960dcb1f2d404b (12:07): at least unless outrage grows much",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:07): I'm worrying about lack of progress",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (12:07): not so much worrying",
