        "61831986744b882b4371990cc1863b19 (17:22): HTML5 was a community-led effort of browser vendors, standards wonks (like Hixie), and other interested parties",

        "61831986744b882b4371990cc1863b19 (17:22): the W3C said no",
        "61831986744b882b4371990cc1863b19 (17:23): so they formed their own working group (WHATWG)",
        "61831986744b882b4371990cc1863b19 (17:23): and started from scratch (since the license of the HTML 4 specification forbids derivative works by non-W3C organizations)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:24): so then it seems this HTML+RDFa effort may just be the next round of crap to be attempted during the overall development of HTML, that will likely eventually die out like the rest.",
        "61831986744b882b4371990cc1863b19 (17:24): HTML+RDFa doesn't appear to have any chance at all of being a good spec until they redefine RDFa in terms of the DOM",
        "61831986744b882b4371990cc1863b19 (17:24): anything else is simply insane",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (17:28): RDFa being based on the source text kinda makes me think of people parsing HTML with regex",

        "b5953de161e07c36c49c96a3c48a128d (17:31): because it so explicitly bound to xml and rdf ?",
        "61831986744b882b4371990cc1863b19 (17:32): which will consist of reverse engineering google's implementation (or whoever ends up being the dominant consumer of RDFa on the public web)",
