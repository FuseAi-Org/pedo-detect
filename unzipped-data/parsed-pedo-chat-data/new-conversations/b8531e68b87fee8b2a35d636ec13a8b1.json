Wouldn't it just be like having a second &quot;state&quot; which was either &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;whatever the secondary mode is&quot;, with the secondary mode being what the insertion mode is now?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:32): what's the benefit of doing it that way?",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:23): You could replace the ':' with a '.', and then your second-to-last sentence would become two sentences and therefore would provide the last sentence.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:23): That would only make a statement about one of the three texts though",
