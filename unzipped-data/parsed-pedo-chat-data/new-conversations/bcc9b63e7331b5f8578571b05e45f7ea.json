JAWS offers a &quot;list tables&quot; feature, and it shows the table summary as a list entrie's caption if available. Makes finding the right table extremely easy. In fact, we're currently revamping some of the Firefox download pages...",
        "1d3bfcfde5ac540a616a25dff751e36f (15:27): ...on mozilla.com, and I advertised for the different tables to get meaningful summaries (they had the same summary text for each table in the first draft). In short, if implemented properly, I, for one, make good use of it.&quot;",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:45): Yeah, so this is a big deal in the html-wg",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:45): I will try to explain why",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:46): Basically the @summary attribute is the canonical way to provide summaries in HTML 4. But it has not been included in HTML 5 so far because it looked like it was not used much, because it looked like it was often used in a bad way and because there are objections to its design",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:47): (the last word there should be &quot;design&quot;)",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:48): The fundamental objection to the design is that it is hidden metadata which means that it seems likely to get out of date because e.g. someone changes the table but doesn't update the summary. And also, it is not avaliable to people not using screen readers, who might also find it useful in some cases",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:48): And I guess it is hard to QA because many web designers don't have screenreaders",
        "4037e3b7c00a7b08907483cb9b8558e1 (15:49): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: And personally I find them very useful. JAWS and other screen readers provide means of navigating to data tables by means of a quick navigation keystroke. The table summary or caption, whichever is present, are then spoken automatically, giving immediate context to what the data table is about.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:49): 4037e3b7c00a7b08907483cb9b8558e1: OK. Do you encounter them often?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:50): Is there generally a difference between the type of content you encounter in &lt;caption&gt; / @summary?",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:50): My understanding is that WCAG suggests that the summary should be longer than the caption",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:51): (maybe JAWS doesn't expose where the data comes from?)",

        "4037e3b7c00a7b08907483cb9b8558e1 (15:52): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: JAWS indicates if it's a summary, the caption is spoken without extra indication. Also, when looking at the flat virtual buffer representation, the summary always preceedes the table structure in JAWS, whereas the caption is part of the table structure.",
        "4037e3b7c00a7b08907483cb9b8558e1 (15:53): And +1 to what 1d3bfcfde5ac540a616a25dff751e36f said.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:53): So the caption could be before or after the table",
        "1d3bfcfde5ac540a616a25dff751e36f (15:54): if you call up a table list in JAWS, if the caption is present it will use that to identify the table, if not and a summary is present it will use the summary",

        "4037e3b7c00a7b08907483cb9b8558e1 (15:55): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: In this example there definitely is a difference, since FS chose to use both summary and caption.",

        "1d3bfcfde5ac540a616a25dff751e36f (15:59): as I mentioned in JAWS if the bogus summarys are on layout tables they are ignored due to the JAWS table heuristics",

Maybe those are not used enough in the wild yet to ahve any real experience of how they are actually employed?",

So, if a caption or summary are available for describing a page, aria-describedby is not particularly recommended, and would have a different effect anyway I *think*.",
