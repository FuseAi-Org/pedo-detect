        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:10): CSS isn't great for changing the order of elements",

        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:49): your problem is that IE doesn't use background-attachment:fixed properly",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:49): your other problem is using tables for layout",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:50): so you and Microsoft are 1-1 at the moment",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:51): Well interestinly enough.. IE does show the picture where FF does not",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:51): In this case (only in this case) I like IE :)",

        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:52): but I'm not digging through unnecessary tables to find out :P",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:53): Ok.. I appearently got more problems",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:53): But what I hope to find out is.. how do I make it work :)",

        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:55): unfortunately you'll need to rearrange most of that HTML",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:55): And yeah.. I use 1 table for layout :D",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:55): that will include removing about half of it though, so it's actually a bonus",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:55): How so?",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:56): Ok.. sorry for being such a noob.. but can you be a bit more specific?",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:56): i am not getting a clear understanding of what is wrong, or a hint what to do to make it work :)",

        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (02:57): Rather not, if you have an idea what's wrong :D",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:57): but you'll have to remove the table bits of the layout",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:57): not &quot;most of it&quot;",

        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (02:58): keep the contents though",

        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:00): first concern, then, is whether it need to look the same as the old site, or whether that old look is barf-worthy",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:00): I'll give you 2 guesses",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:00): Oh definately the 2nd!",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:01): heh",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:01): The project is horrible",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:01): the management is worse",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:01): 4 people work on that very site, everyone of them has even less knowledge than I do :)",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:01): That's why I first want a clear structure (which is lacking) to procede from there",
        "28e2307e1643c3378ae21fa68a1cef63 (03:04): Shariff: try first to remove that word fixed and I guess it would work for you",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:04): well firstly, remove the word 'fixed'",
        "bc061e0e2ca567fd3e1cb6792cf4bfc6 (03:05): how do I make it so a text element in a form can't be modified?",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:05): existance: depends why",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:05): do you still want the field submitted with the for,?",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:05): *form",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:06): Thanks!",

        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:06): you could argus that is should be in a &lt;div&gt; then - &lt;input&gt; is for, well, inputting",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:06): but &lt;input disabled=&quot;disabled&quot;&gt; will work",

        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:07): you should use the div if all you're worried about is how it looks - that can be corrected with CSS",
        "28e2307e1643c3378ae21fa68a1cef63 (03:07): Shariff: you are the first to confirm that I know something that someone in the world doesn't know ;)",

        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:08): the background directives in css are also moved when you use a div's padding?",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:09): see, they shouldn't",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:09): I couldn't work out why they were either",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:10): Cool :)",
        "28e2307e1643c3378ae21fa68a1cef63 (03:12): Shariff: sorry you mean you want the background to be fixed or what?",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:13): edgy: adding padding-left to the div with the background actually moves the background too :-/",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:14): What GarethAdams said :)",
        "28e2307e1643c3378ae21fa68a1cef63 (03:14): GarethAdams: and why is this strange? which class are you adding padding to?",

        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:15): I think",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:15): I've closed the window now",
        "28e2307e1643c3378ae21fa68a1cef63 (03:16): GarethAdams: Shariff should just add a padding-left to &quot;p&quot; class to move the text only",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:16): Then I would do a margin-left...",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:16): padding shouldn't move the background",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:16): But then I need to do that with every class/id within that div",

        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:17): I though so too..",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:17): remove 'top' from your background CSS rule",
        "28e2307e1643c3378ae21fa68a1cef63 (03:17): Shariff: no just do p { padding-left: 20px}",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:17): as well as fixed",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:17): then the padding-left will work fine",
        "f9f55a3e8be14fc877a9ae5642b53041 (03:18): basically, that 'top' is short for 'top center'",
        "9f784624eb74e08bda5b3a25988a2735 (03:18): Thanks!!",
