        "df837edb9fd9c9790aee74960928c9f1 (17:12): but that would require the user to always make an exact selection, so you could work with the line of selection.start and that of selection.end",
        "df837edb9fd9c9790aee74960928c9f1 (17:12): and check if to the left or to right of the selection start and end offsets you can find /* (for start) and */ (for end)",
