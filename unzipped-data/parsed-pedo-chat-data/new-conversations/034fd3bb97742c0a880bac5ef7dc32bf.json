        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:29): what's in html4 doesn't match what they do",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (23:30): i don't understand the question",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:33): it's not a question",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:34): ie 'codebase' != html4 'codebase'",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (23:34): oh",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (23:34): indeed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:34): so ie's attribute wasn't included in the html4 spec",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:34): even if the name was used by ie before the spec came out",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (23:35): true, but if ms used the attribute name first it isn't their fault that it is in conflict with html4",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (23:36): that's what i meant",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (23:37): ...unless ms were in the html wg back then defining it",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:38): Chris said &quot;the WHATWG HTML5 removes a few key attributes from the &lt;object&gt; element that were in HTML 4.01 - namely, classid and codebase - that are heavily used by ActiveX in IE&quot;, which is why it's relevant to say that IE isn't actually using those HTML 4.01 attributes",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:38): (independent of whose fault it is that the spec and the implementation disagree)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (23:39): yes",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:41): hi everyone",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (23:51): &quot;inline structure&quot; reveals at least &lt;code&gt; and &lt;abbr&gt; it seems",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (00:14): is display:table-cell on its own handled correctly in latest webkit? (i.e. is http://simon.html5.org/temp/w3c-home-in-html5.html rendered in three columns or one column?)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:17): I'm surprised the HTML5 proposal made it to slashdot but not digg or reddit (yet)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (00:24): apparently it isn't. i can't find a bug about it in bugzilla either.",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (00:24): thought it was a known bug",

        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (00:26): where could i read your proposal for CSS replacement of &quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:26): don't think i ever wrote it down",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:27): basically it's ::text-before(/regexp/) or something",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (00:27): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, Interesting. Do you know how easy or hard that would be to implement?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:28): probably quite hard, pseudo-elements in general are a bitch",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:29): i can't believe chris honestly doesn't see how what he's doing is exactly what microsoft keeps doing to sustain their monopolies",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:29): sometimes people laugh at &quot;don't be evil&quot;, but it's exactly this kind of thing that google's culture prevents",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (00:30): wonders what MS have  done now...",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:30): the versioning thing in the html list",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:35): we do try to build the anonymous rendering strctures needed for CSS tables but there could certainly be bugs",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:36): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I was going to point out that his citation of Windows and Office does little to dispel fears of acting in bad faith",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:36): but I have not finished reading his essay yet",
