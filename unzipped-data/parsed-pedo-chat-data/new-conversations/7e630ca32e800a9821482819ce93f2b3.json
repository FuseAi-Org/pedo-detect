        "be33adfac43ea8ab0d9d974e1add1d80 (08:01): I've created a merge table out of an overly large log table, splitting it by month.  When I try to select on the merge table's DateTime field, BETWEEN 20060330235000 AND 20060401010000,  it gives me all the records in the March subtable.  Is there a problem with range lookups on merge tables?",
        "edc181cf0de0c3cc8babe6b187714363 (08:01): that's quite a lot of rows :) i don't have anything topping 50m.  did the first 10m rows fit in memory?",
        "edc181cf0de0c3cc8babe6b187714363 (08:01): their indices that is",

        "be33adfac43ea8ab0d9d974e1add1d80 (08:02): yeah I figured that was the case, not a big deal.  I did meet the MySQL Press peeps though",
        "edc181cf0de0c3cc8babe6b187714363 (08:03): well, the speed of the index repairing that it does when it loads the data in",
        "edc181cf0de0c3cc8babe6b187714363 (08:03): is going to be based on the size of the indexes and a few buffer sizes and a fewo ther things",
        "be33adfac43ea8ab0d9d974e1add1d80 (08:04): I'm gonna get my writing on here pretty soon, once I figure out this merge table issue.  Some fools at my company let this log table grow to 45GB so when we had a hardware problem and had to reboot, the 45GB reindex took a little too long",
