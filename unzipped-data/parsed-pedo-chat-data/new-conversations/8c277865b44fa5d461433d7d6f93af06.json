        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (10:47): will refrain from making any suggestions on handling rel=&quot;alternate stylesheet&quot; similarly to how HTML5 microdata handles it (as a single token)",

        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (11:08): the thing is: I'm interested in the Web of Data where data comes from whatever nicely machine-processable format",
