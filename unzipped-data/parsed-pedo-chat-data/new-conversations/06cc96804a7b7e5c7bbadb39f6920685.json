        "fce8e8f1f5eb450d51e74727c4b835ec (21:18): hmm, I've got a problem with my menu. I'm trying to dynamically generate a menu, so I created a vector&lt;QAction*&gt; accountAct and added several actions: accountAct.push_back(accountMenu-&gt;addAction(&quot;...&quot;));",
        "fce8e8f1f5eb450d51e74727c4b835ec (21:18): then connect(accountAct[0], SIGNAL(triggered()), this, SLOT(loadAccountfM(1)));",
        "fce8e8f1f5eb450d51e74727c4b835ec (21:19): this doesn't seem to trigger the loadAccountfM function at all",
        "fce8e8f1f5eb450d51e74727c4b835ec (21:20): is this because I can't put numbers in the brackets?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:24): Giggel: No, the problem is in your slot call.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:24): Giggel: You can't specify parameters in the signal or slot macros, only data types, and the signatures for the signal and slot have to match.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:24): Giggel: The signal is allowed to have more parameters than the slot.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:25): Giggel: If you need that functionality, use QSignalMapper to bounce the signals or use the sender() function in the slot to get a pointer to the object that triggered it.",
        "fce8e8f1f5eb450d51e74727c4b835ec (21:25): hossa",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:25): Giggel: As a final note, you could use QList or QVector instead of std::vector",
        "87210df20b5a76dfaa75970aab41eeb1 (21:26): better :)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:26): Actually, for what it's worth, you really don't need the vector at all because accountMenu-&gt;actions() will contain the same thing",
        "87210df20b5a76dfaa75970aab41eeb1 (21:27): hm",
        "87210df20b5a76dfaa75970aab41eeb1 (21:28): ok, that's good. so I replace the global vector by a local variable",
        "87210df20b5a76dfaa75970aab41eeb1 (21:30): and read the connect help to see how to pass an additional parameter to be able to differentiate between the calls",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:31): Like I said",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:32): Either use QSignalMapper or sender()",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:32): QSignalMapper is better OO, sender() is less code",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:33): Actually, sender() may not be less code after all.",
        "87210df20b5a76dfaa75970aab41eeb1 (21:33): so you don't see a different aproach?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:33): Those ARE the approaches.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:33): That's how you're supposed to do it.",
        "87210df20b5a76dfaa75970aab41eeb1 (21:33): good",
