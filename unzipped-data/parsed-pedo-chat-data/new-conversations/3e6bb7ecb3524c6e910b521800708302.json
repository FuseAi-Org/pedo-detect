        "e46c339b9a8e8603453f5ec2a1f50f91 (22:01): Yeah, works for me too.",
        "d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9 (22:01): i just get an html page with an empty body",

        "d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9 (22:02): very strange",

        "d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9 (22:03): while i'm at it, is there a way i could make a canvas element have the same size as the client area of the browser window ?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:04): Is it adequate to rescale it with CSS, or do you want the bitmap dimensions to change too?",
        "d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9 (22:06): well i'm trying to make it have the same size as the client area, then i want to draw something inside",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (22:07): btw, do sites rely on image maps being css pixels rather than following the size of the image? i've found 1 site that doesn't work correctly because of this behavior",
        "d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9 (22:07): i tried &lt;canvas style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;&gt; but firefox keeps giving me a 300px wide canvas",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:08): If you want to change the bitmap's size, you need &lt;canvas width=... height=...&gt;",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:08): or set canvas.width=... etc with JavaScript",

        "d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9 (22:09): you mean drawing happens in the 300x150 space then it's interpolated ?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:09): d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9: Yes (since the bitmap's default size is 300x150 if you don't specify width= anywhere)",
        "d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9 (22:11): ok i did not know bitmap's default size was 300x150",

        "d85362faae75ddbec33d4870191c72e9 (22:12): gonna try to play a bit with javascript to adjust the size then",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:13): It might be useful to know that the canvas gets reset to its default empty state whenever you resize it, which might be a pain if you're making it dynamically resize to fit some other object",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:15): I get the impression that they were much more popular when HTML4 was being developed, so it was more worthwhile trying to handle them accessibly; but now anybody who cares about accessibility won't be using server-side image maps at all",
