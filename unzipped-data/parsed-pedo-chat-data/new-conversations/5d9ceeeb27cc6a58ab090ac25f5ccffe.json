        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:12): I'd go for Dell's UltraSharp range \u201a\u00c4\u00ee\u00ac\u2020they use (in the 20&quot;, 24&quot;, and 30&quot; cases) the same LCD panels as the Apple monitors, and tend to be otherwise just as good if not better, as well as being far cheaper",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (00:13): the easy thing with apple is that you only need to pick a size",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:13): sadly the mini can't drive the biggest cinema displays, but oh well",
