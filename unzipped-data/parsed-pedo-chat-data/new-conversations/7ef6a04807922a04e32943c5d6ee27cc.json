        "05500b78fe7440a578ac1d6c7d45c3e0 (21:20): IE9 was released yesterday",

        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:23): oh wait, they have to get off XP first",
        "05500b78fe7440a578ac1d6c7d45c3e0 (21:34): 0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17: what are your thoughts?",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:34): dunno, haven't been able to touch IE9",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:34): i either run linux or XP",
        "05500b78fe7440a578ac1d6c7d45c3e0 (21:35): well two stay ahead as developers we need to run all latest browsers",
        "05500b78fe7440a578ac1d6c7d45c3e0 (21:35): so this has me thinking because I have XP as well..",
        "05500b78fe7440a578ac1d6c7d45c3e0 (21:35): but I need IE9",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:36): i figure let IE9 render whatever it can, and if it can't handle that feature still...too bad",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:36): i test in the browsers i have at least &quot;D",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:36): :D",
        "05500b78fe7440a578ac1d6c7d45c3e0 (21:37): i don't that's a good mindset but anyway",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:37): as i put it to twitter a day or two ago, IE9...finally IE catches up to a year ago",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:38): unless they completely refactor their release policy, they're always going to be playing catchup",
        "05500b78fe7440a578ac1d6c7d45c3e0 (21:38): well that's obvious",

        "cb7ab3f9defdf9c5e0dafb3c934724da (21:59): err.. sorry about that. was just going to say that infact, that does seem to whitelist it, as the script references are updated, i'm just having issues getting the html minified..",
        "cb7ab3f9defdf9c5e0dafb3c934724da (21:59): which may be due to my own environment and java issues..  which i'm working on",

        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (22:10): but it should be totally doable.",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (22:10): maybe sorta.",
