        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:43): I'm not buying that at all",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:43): which means we might be stuck with -76 forever at the current rate the IETF is doing things",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (18:44): Well yeah I said that back in July",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (18:45): And they eventually agreed in mid August to finish stuff on a four week timescale",

But HTML elements and attributes are lowercased before getting to the DOM in text/html, so how is that different?",
