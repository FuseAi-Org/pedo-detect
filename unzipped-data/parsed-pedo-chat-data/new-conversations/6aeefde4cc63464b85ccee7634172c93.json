        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:22): its not the interface its the host ip right",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:22): yea",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:23): oh snap wow ok",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:23): i have to try that",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:23): you might need to stick a deny line in the ACL for the nat so that it forces the router to route it insted of nat it... make sense ?",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:23): yea",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:23): what about stateful packet inspection it seems like it might have an issue with that",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:24): its that  best effort thing and I think if I recall correctly that nat is tryed first...but I could be wrong there, its been a while since I had to deal with htis",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:24): hmmm",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:24): I dont do it at home so I cant answer...",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:24): when alt or nemith come on they will more likley be the people you will want to direct the packet inspection questions to",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:25): because the packet looks like it would still be destined for the public ip, as it wouldnt have passed through the nat engine i dont think, so the host(internal ip) would be getting a packet sent to it with the external ip and it wouldnt accept it becauyse it would match its own ip",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:26): very interesting",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:32): hrmm I see what your saying, and as you have the public interface as untrusted stuff could go wonky...",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:32): route map'ing might be the way to go",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:33): well, actually if its a static route, destined for the host on your local network but using an external network address it never will pass outside of the external interface...",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:33): the routing will prevent this...",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:33): so the packet inspection will not be part of the path",
        "eb60d698ffb08c8a17a25436417c75e8 (18:34): did I mention that I have a touch of a hang over and my secretary isnt here yet with my coffee and my assistant is late and my morning has been pretty grueling...",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:35): haha sorry about that",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:36): whered to you work?",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:36): in about 30 i leave to work, in LA at an isp",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:39): even if it doesnt pass the outside interface it still has a destination ip that is public so even if the packet is sent to the internal host it has a external public ip on it, thus the local host is gonna see the packet on the wire and when it tried to matcha against its own ip it wont match, then again i could be wrong, it might not even look at the dest ip, it might just be looking at the dest MAC",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:39): and in that case it would work fine",
        "70b41cfe8e52983499c45991780b69f1 (18:41): yes im trying to bridge vlans",
        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:43): is it possible to have a router in the middle of one subnet? and have it act almost like a transparent firewall? last time i tried to stick 2 ips from the same subnet on 2 interfaces of a cisco it bitched at me",
        "3dc188249902127a113122095c51d2d8 (18:45): ...",

        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:50): or what method would be used for that?",

        "fb39a13c46d4561647dee305a314bcb8 (18:53): its not really solution for me, i just wanted to know if i could",
