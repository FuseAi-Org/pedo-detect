        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (16:16): Maybe the process needs to be improved to prevent that from happening",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:16): and yesterday around 3 or 4",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:27): someone should raise a objection about the violation of process that allowed that non-process related e-mail to get through.",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (17:01): (in fact, with caching it's not even that much of a perf hit to do it in a loop)",
