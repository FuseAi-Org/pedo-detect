        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:05): I would like to have your advises regarding the technologies to set up for an ethernet LAN in a private flat",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:05): practically immaterial...",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:06): (ask me to precise if needed I'm french ;) )",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:06): what's the problem?",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:07): I live in a flat, where there is only students",
        "a517096ca4327d4179146e866a96e672 (02:07): Triffid_Hunter, are you there?",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:07): and we would like to share internet connections",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:09): We have decided to set up a wired LAN (if possible RJ45) but my question is, is it possible to make it with only one line and if so will it be fast enough ?",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:09): Cilyan, what kind of connection do you have? DSL?",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:10): Yes DSL",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:10): yes, of course, just use a router",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:10): you can get a combined DSL modem/router or just put one downstream",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:10): it will multiplex the connection",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:12): We have already it, and last year, we used to connect each other on the router",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:14): But as the rooms are separated, we put the lines from one window to another by the outside",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:15): But the director found it very ugly all these lines on the outside of the flat and decided to remove them and put them in the inside",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:15): OK...",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:16): So we have to put them... arg! english ... sorry juste wait a minute '^^",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:18): thx google :p... So we have to put the line in the electric sheath and as the flat is long, it will be great if we were able to put just on line through the sheath",
        "849fd989f7b4965e4d6097592727b44a (02:19): Mmmmm new machine is here and fassssssstttt",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:21): Cilyan, if you use an active hub or two (pretty cheap), it will work",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:22): &quot;active hub&quot; you mean something to repeat signal ?",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:22): (when the line is too long?)",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:23): it's not a repeater but another kind of multiplexer",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:23): just look for a &quot;hub&quot; (or &quot;switch&quot;, which is a little fancier)",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:24): Ah ... (I know what hub or switch mean, but I wasn't sure of the translation :p)",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:24): Ok, but with this, I will have many lines",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:25): only downstream",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:26): Cilyan: have you looked into wireless options?",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:28): jzono1: Walls are too big, wireless doesn't go through more than 3 rooms",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:30): uhm",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:30): wrong",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:31): just grab one big badass antenna for the router",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:33): hmm, I'm afraid the cost would be too high ...",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:38): ok, just one more question: if I put hubs on the network, which bitrate will I reach if I connect together about 15 computers ?",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:38): (hubs, not switches)",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:39): hubs limit your bandwidth more than switches, but will still probably be faster than your DSL uplink",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:39): Sure, but for file sharing ?",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:40): For example with a wireless link, the link is so bad that a film (650Mo) take 2h30' to donwload",
        "c3a0e27b463971793444b182b3738834 (02:40): from internet?",
        "c3a0e27b463971793444b182b3738834 (02:41): or another computer?",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:41): Cilyan, uplink is always the bottleneck",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:41): there is no way you can afford an internet connection as fast as your LAN would be",
        "c3a0e27b463971793444b182b3738834 (02:41): brick, sometimes a poor wifi connection makes it wrose",
        "c3a0e27b463971793444b182b3738834 (02:41): worse",
        "c3a0e27b463971793444b182b3738834 (02:41): DL that is",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:42): no, I talk about computer to computer inside the LAN",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:42): use switches if you are worried about it",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:42): without going through internet connection",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:42): 100baseT switch is way, way fast enough",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:44): ok... but problem stay if all connections goes trough on line ....",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:44): *one",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (02:46): look, either try it or don't",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:47): yes, you're right ...",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:48): When there is switches on the line, more than one computer can talk on medias on different sides of the switch or is it forbidden ? (Collision Detection)",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:48): Cilyan: you can make it go through one line if you use a switch for every second computer",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:48): (a standard cat5 cable has enough leads for two 100mbit links)",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:49): Cilyan: not forbidden",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:49): jzono1: yes, that's what I think to do, but I wonder if 15 computer won't be too much for just one link",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:49): uhm",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:50): no",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:50): Ok... I think that's all ^^",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:50): (ouf! :) )",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:50): it will give plenty enough bandwidth",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:50): Thank you very much (you're very patient you know :p)",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:51): the best solution would be multiple cat5s and one big gigabit switch",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:52): Oh, just to finish, is it possible to link two switches with two lines ?",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:52): or is it dangerous ?",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:53): it's silly",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:53): lol, ok ^^",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:54): thanks a lot",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:54): 100mbit is plenty enough for 15 computers",
        "5ab3b9ae38a4e155c0c676c21e71412c (02:54): Have a good ... uh ... for me it's night :)",
        "ac4af998947102f0adce14f13d55438a (02:55): same here",
