        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:43): once saw a site that encrypted a password plus today's date rounded to 6 months, to generate a URL for a private page",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:44): and if you got the wrong password then you'd get the wrong URL, and if you had the URL then it'd only be valid for 6 months",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:44): but I could find a few of those 6-month URLs since they'd leaked out onto Google",
