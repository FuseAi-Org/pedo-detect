        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:24): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: &quot;valid URL attribute value&quot; is a little shorter (assuming that is equally accurate)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:24): or even just &quot;URL attribute value&quot; if there is no need for the non-valid version",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:25): i'd rather not call the syntax by where it's used",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:26): that always ends up giving me trouble later when i reuse the syntaxes",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:29): &quot;space-delimited URL&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:32): i'll just go with potentially surrounded by spaces, it's less ambiguous",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:42): it does seem like a pretty unambiguous choice",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:53): me tries to figure out which way the wind blowing on adding presence of role=presentation as an exception to the alt-required constraint",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (08:53): morning good chaps &amp; ladies.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:54): if it is favorable I could add it speculatively/experimentally now to the checker in the interest of giving something broader to test against",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:54): or I could hold off and just do it for now as close to the existing spec as I can get",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:56): your first name has a (tm) in it also?",

        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:07): hey, 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e thanks for the slight tip last night on where to look for the protocol details on websockets, so far I've got the server accepting clients and reading the headers",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:07): cool",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:07): ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2: your parents clearly have more imagination than mine",

        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:11): so far most I've seen don't even parse the headers correctly",

        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:11): because, theoretically there aren't any headers not allowed",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:12): plus, they use a fixed order for them, which isn't correct",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:12): that's why the latest draft requires the servers to parse two headers, because otherwise the servers wouldn't parse any and would be vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack from HTTP",

        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:13): two headers? I've missed that one.. I'll have to check up on it",

        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:13): oh, I thought they were part of the first GET request",
