There is no way in hell that a screenreader can know &lt;acronym&gt;SMIL&lt;/acronym&gt; is to be pronounced like \u201a\u00c4\u00f2smile\u201a\u00c4\u00f4, nor can it know that &lt;acronym&gt;SQL&lt;/acronym&gt; has to be pronounced \u201a\u00c4\u00f2sequel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4. Unless it has a list of pronounciations built-in, in which case the author doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need to indicate any distinction in the first place.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:46): css isn't a data format?",

        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:47): it merely conveys how to present the information",

        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:50): to me at information is primarily stuff like address information, etc, something you would express with RDF",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:52): ok then",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:52): I'm not trying to make an argument for versioning information, I said it depends on design decisions of the language",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:53): and that maybe the reference to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2data format\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 could be interpreted as so",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (07:53): 98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a, when would it ever be a good design desicion to include versioning?",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:53): that it would only cover \u201a\u00c4\u00f2semantic\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 information",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:54): for implementors versioning sucks, but I think there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been a fair number of arguments presented where it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s useful as well",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:54): even if just so that if you see the document, you know \u201a\u00c4\u00f2oh it was documented according to this version of the standard. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll stick to that than, so that the risk of adding stuff that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work in the systems it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s intended to be used for is minimal\u201a\u00c4\u00f4",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:55): why would a specification's version be useful for that? surely you'd want to specify an authoring subset or at most an implementation version",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:56): language versions have very little bearing on what set of features authors use",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:56): Backbase software has been through three major versions by now, all incompatible",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:56): even among minor versions there have been some incompatibilities (unintentionally, I suppose)",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:57): the version information is not indicated however, because it simply depends on which version of the library is included, and which namespace is used",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:57): right but with HTML you have more than one implementation",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:58): so even with one _language_ version you'll have incompatibilities",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:58): e.g. as now with CSS and HTML and DOM and JS and so forth",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:58): yeah, so that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a per-language consideration",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:58): no",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:58): it's a per IMPLEMENTATION consideration at most",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:58): ...depends on how well the implementations are done, I think.",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:59): with the browsers, we got unlucky in that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s kind of a mess",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (07:59): versioning works if its enforced in the implementation",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:59): but if you look at internet standards like IP, etc",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (07:59): you can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t really implement it \u201a\u00c4\u00f2incompletely\u201a\u00c4\u00f4",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:00): If Javascript 2 only works when you specify that version there's no room for erroneous mixing in features, and you can fix things later with explicit reference to what set of features you're using",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:01): a problem with a lot of ideas that some people have (like anne's xml-should-have-error-recovery) is that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a view that really doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t apply to all areas",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:01): Some XML implementations have some level of error recovery :)",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:01): e.g. programming languages are usually not forgiving in their syntax error handling, yet they have been used widely and it forms no obstacle to programmers (rather, a help)",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:01): Webkit doesn't show a yellow screen when it sees a malformed document",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:02): 98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a, the counter argument is that all media decoders (mp3, video etc.) implement error recovery when the file is malformed",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:02): XML is very often used to contain a programming language as well, and for data I also think it would be bad to allow the risk of data being incorrectly error-corrected to say something else than that it actually was supposed to mean",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:03): so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very specific to the domain",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:03): same is true for versioning information I think",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:03): or feature indication (pretty much the same thing, but more flexible)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (08:04): 8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc, WebKit does show an error for malformed content (although it's not yellow like Mozilla)",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:04): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, it shows the page rendered up until that point, mozilla shows nothing but the error",

        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:04): if they just didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work at all, people wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t share them",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:04): and I wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be bothered by them",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (08:04): oh, I see what you mean",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:05): I think both approaches are ok, as long as there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s something that forces the programmers of the backend to implement something that never generates invalid XML",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (08:06): unfortunately, that doesn't always happen in reality",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:06): if all browsers support XHTML, it will, for sites that serve XHTML",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (08:06): There's plenty of systems out there that claim to support XML, but only have tag soup parsers",

        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:07): because they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re forced to, in the same manner as programmers are forced to make sure their code compiles",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:07): anyway, have to go (again), I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll read the backlog when I get back :)",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:07): Its more complicated for your word document to become invalid, so most word documents are valid",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (08:07): e.g. feed readers, mobile phones, etc. all use tag soup parsers for XML",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:07): With XHTML its pretty easy to introduce an anomaly which would invalidate the entire document.",
        "98e5b851bd2fd05b0d06825182bc9a9a (08:07): my feed reader (Sage) uses a true XML parser, and it works just fine (most of the time ;p)",
