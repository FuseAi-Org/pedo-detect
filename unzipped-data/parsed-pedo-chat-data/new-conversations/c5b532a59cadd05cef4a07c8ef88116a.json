        "33ed8c96b2b06385e426e5bcf6935cf8 (04:45): yeah, that's the one. I have seen it",
        "33ed8c96b2b06385e426e5bcf6935cf8 (04:47): timeless: possibly because you specified a naming service before that point?",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (04:47): the solaris installer really needs an overhaul I mean it works well",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (04:47): but could use some eye candy",
        "c55963a3bec158d36e87abc2f9085a9e (04:48): jmcp: yeah i specified dns",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (04:48): especially compared to what these hacked up distros are doing these days",
        "c55963a3bec158d36e87abc2f9085a9e (04:48): was i not supposed to do that?",
        "8c27c6238210e78d0cff9690db08116b (04:48): jmcpAtSun, you've heard of DHCP and YP then?",
        "c55963a3bec158d36e87abc2f9085a9e (04:48): i'm used to things that ask me if i want to use dhcp to realize they can get dns servers from the dhcp service",
        "33ed8c96b2b06385e426e5bcf6935cf8 (04:49): I think the installer is playing it safe by not assuming that your DHCP server will actually provide *all* the information that you need",
        "33ed8c96b2b06385e426e5bcf6935cf8 (04:49): g4lt-U60: funnily enough, I actually have",
        "c55963a3bec158d36e87abc2f9085a9e (04:49): the installer could play it safe by prefillying the information from the dhcp server",
        "8c27c6238210e78d0cff9690db08116b (04:49): good god, the bletcherousness of htat simply boggles the imagination",
        "c55963a3bec158d36e87abc2f9085a9e (04:50): it's a good thing i have a second computer that can talk to them",

        "c55963a3bec158d36e87abc2f9085a9e (04:50): i presume that this thing isn't going to destroy my hard drive",
        "c55963a3bec158d36e87abc2f9085a9e (04:50): but it hasn't asked yet :(",
        "c55963a3bec158d36e87abc2f9085a9e (04:51): ooh, there's the upgrade option :)",
        "e6320bbf98fd0b6222b7279be01bcec9 (04:51): i installed nexenta on a usb hard drive, then moved it into a laptop as and ide drive. now i can boot into grub but solaris can't mount the root device. what would i need to change to make this work?",
        "8c27c6238210e78d0cff9690db08116b (04:51): jmcpAtSun, no the reason that the installer exhibits that behavior is that solaris's DHCP client exhibits many levels of brokenness, like not accepting most of the inrformation from the DHCP server without manula intervention",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (04:51): did your device name change?",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (04:51): check your grub.conf?",

        "8c27c6238210e78d0cff9690db08116b (04:52): yeah, but the installer by definition cannot",
        "e6320bbf98fd0b6222b7279be01bcec9 (04:53): rodrickbrown: yes it would have had to. can i use grub to manually boot the first time so i can get in to change my grub.conf?",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (04:54): nailbags, not sure actually consult the grub doc",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (04:54): i really have limited exp. with grub",
        "e6320bbf98fd0b6222b7279be01bcec9 (04:58): rodrickbrown: well i know how to do what i'm trying to do in linux. in linux i can press 'e' and change the boot device and the kernel command line. then boot up, enter maintinence mode to change the grub.conf and /etc/fstab, then reboot. i want to do something like that.",
        "33ed8c96b2b06385e426e5bcf6935cf8 (04:59): nailbags|work: you can do that too with grub on Solaris",
        "33ed8c96b2b06385e426e5bcf6935cf8 (04:59): add &quot;-s&quot; to the kernel line",
