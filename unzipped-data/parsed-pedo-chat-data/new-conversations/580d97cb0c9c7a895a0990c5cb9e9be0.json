        "8a27c260bf051e11b0c7d661de811072 (15:58): Defragmentation on HFS+ volumes should not be necessary at all, or worthwhile, in most cases, because the system seems to do a very good job of avoiding/countering fragmentation.",
        "8a27c260bf051e11b0c7d661de811072 (15:58): It is risky to defragment anyway: What if there's a power glitch? What if the system crashes? What if the defragmenting tool has a bug? What if you inadvertently reboot? In some cases, you could make the situation worse by defragmenting.",

        "8a27c260bf051e11b0c7d661de811072 (16:00): Zyroth, you should keep more free space on all your partition; in order to avoid this frag things, since HFS+ should be able to &quot;defrags&quot;  himself",
        "5b071d2ef49b0a84a2b96e649ea8642f (16:01): Well maybe I should",
