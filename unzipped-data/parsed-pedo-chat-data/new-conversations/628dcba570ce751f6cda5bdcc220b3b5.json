        "785b6c5eb00e035cb34e3f5a10887595 (09:40): add a subsurf modifier",
        "785b6c5eb00e035cb34e3f5a10887595 (09:40): or select vertices and click on smooth",

        "785b6c5eb00e035cb34e3f5a10887595 (09:41): so you only subsurf these vertices",
        "b7cfbed8c323ab16f7c780635cafa9c6 (09:42): But... it gets aplied to whole mesh..",
        "785b6c5eb00e035cb34e3f5a10887595 (09:43): in edit mode",

        "42192e9b6adc8a45c267e6bfffeb4706 (09:47): if you have multiple modifiers applied, try moving them up and down in the stack to see interesting changes. (sometimes)",
