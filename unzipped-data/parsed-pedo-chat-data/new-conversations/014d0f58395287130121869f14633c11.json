        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:11): the process is the same as with any other .net language, if its a project add it into the solution and reference the project, if its an assembly the reference the dll",
        "97a1e9685bb70a305114109c2ca472a8 (13:11): neither its up to me, I have some C++ code, and I need to use it with my C# program",

        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:13): just checking ;)",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:13): create a new managed c++ project under your solution and wang it in there",
        "97a1e9685bb70a305114109c2ca472a8 (13:13): yup my friend told me to use this code, rather than VB stuff",

        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:14): me neither ... i think if once you have your project then  create a new class",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:15): that'll give you a header file and a class file",
        "97a1e9685bb70a305114109c2ca472a8 (13:15): yeah with auto generated crap",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:15): put the header in the header and the class in the class",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:15): just overwrite and see if it works",
        "97a1e9685bb70a305114109c2ca472a8 (13:15): but the class names are different",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:15): change them? :P",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (13:15): Applet_User: copy the code into files of the same name",
        "97a1e9685bb70a305114109c2ca472a8 (13:15): but i was told i need to link the assemble in my C# part",

        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (13:17): Applet_User: don't do what smellyhippy says, because it's pointless to make new empty files and copy code into them",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:17): well seeing as you dont already have the file :P",
        "97a1e9685bb70a305114109c2ca472a8 (13:17): right lets try that",
        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:17): rikkus: obviously you checked the link he provided :P",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (13:18): I see, they don't provide files to download... they usually do",

        "78dbc21d2902c96d3067f18f609ca04c (13:18): otherwise i would have told him to just include the provicded project",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (13:19): then yes, do as smellyhippy says :)",

        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (13:21): just remember that you have to read the console to see errors",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (13:22): which is not much use, generally",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (13:22): I suppose you can just take out the try ... catch blocks and handle errors yourself... at least return an error from Write()!",
