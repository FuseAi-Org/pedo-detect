        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:14): how can I find put whats wrong with a kernel module, if modload &lt;module&gt; fails with: can't load module: Invalid argument",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:15): s/put/out",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:15): man modload ?",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:15): well, ok, not bad for a generic answer",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:17): but unfortunately man modload does not give any hints on that specific (or any other) diagnostic messages.",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (17:18): sokrates, 99% of the time modload is not needed. it usually just works fine out of the box",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:18): well, I guess I'm on the 1% margin.",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:19): I just wanted to load the openAFS module",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:19): but (I guess) its in the wrong object format",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:19): or whatever?",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:20): e.g. modload will tell me I provided an invalid argument for almost every file on the system (except for kernel modules)",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (17:21): the OS will usually load the module when you mount filesystem... openAFS is a filesystem right/",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (17:21): er?",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:21): well yes openAFS is an implementation of afs which is a file system",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:22): and the problem is, that the initialisation of afs fails --- because the module is not loaded",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:22): so I just tried to hand load the module, which fails",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:23): this just tells me that solaris does not consider this file to be a kernel module",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:25): OpenAFS does not deliver a pkg or installer, but just some Object files.  I thought maybe these Object files need some final polishing to become full kernel modules",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:25): ...hmm...",
        "f0bf84c708be73b2b3396820dedf6e23 (17:25): complicated to explain, isn't it.",

        "24d64d4e061b0a84afeb2b00ce97fdbf (17:30): Cass, after &quot;ifconfig ce0:1 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up&quot; it says &quot;ifconfig: SIOCGLIFNETMASK: ce0:1: no such interface&quot;",

        "25f1ed0313af2137c5858c6b3df760d0 (17:53): wouldnt bind just resolve though the data, if your client uses the 2nd ip as its dns server ?",
