        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:18): looks like a validator bug to me",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:20): it fails on data:text/html;charset=utf-8,&lt;!DOCTYPE%20HTML&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;object%20type%3D&quot;image/png&quot;%20data%3D&quot;http://example.com/test.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt; too",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:20): which i'm pretty sure is valid",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:36): f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905: i was looking at the vCard spec and it doesn't say the N needs to actually have any data, just that it has to be present",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (02:42): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: In fact, &quot;normal internet users&quot;  have to be pretty careful about how they use H.264. See http://bemasc.net/wordpress/2010/02/02/no-you-cant-do-that-with-h264/ ... that's mostly about video production, but it also turns out that e.g. playing video using Flash for &quot;commercial use&quot; is also forbidden",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:43): man i hate working on the drag-and-drop API",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:59): Internet broadcast is free until 2016, and that includes sites with ads, so unless you plan to set up full-blown commerical operation...",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:11): it's true, if you just want to watch Youtube you'll be fine.",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:11): Or post your own videos",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:12): to Youtube",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:12): Or your blog",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:12): I believe that technically, you need to execute a license for that. You won't have to pay royalties until 2016.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:13): it's pretty clear that until H.264 is freely usable without any license nonsense, it's not a workable solution.",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (03:14): plus the weird stuff they recently replied to for open source software",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:14): usable and implementable, yes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:15): (and i mean Free, not $0)",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (03:15): and then the one where you cannot do commercial content, even if you have a license to Final Cut Pro",

        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (03:15): even if they won't go after people for such infringements, it's still a scary state",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:16): those restrictions were always there, people just didn't know or care",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:16): of course most still don't, as long as they can watch Youtube",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:16): which is fine",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (03:16): it's good it is being exposed - mostly it was unknown till now",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (03:17): I'm still hoping Google will &quot;do good&quot; and provide an Ogg alternative of YouTube, too",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (03:17): it's a massive transcoding effort, but then they did that for mobile content and HD content, too",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (03:18): I don't mind large corporates continuing to use H.264 - but it shouldn't be forced upon the small guys",

        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:40): Much of the &quot;optimizations&quot; for n (and fn and others) were design/built to bridge the impedance mismatch/gap between the way people author content (only what they have to / seems obvious), and the strict top-down a-priori requirements of various formats.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:41): given the years of experience we've had with hCard (and n and fn uses), there's definitely been a few cases where some optimizations can be dropped, others can be improved/refined, and there's room for a few more too (again, based on experience with what authors have tried to do with hCard)",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:41): I've captured much of this in hcard-brainstorming for hCard 1.0.1 (and similarly for hCalendar)",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:42): essentially all such &quot;optimizations&quot; come down to making the vocabularies more *usable*",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:42): anyway - feel free to jump into #microformats for more on hCard/vcard/n/fn etc.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:43): btw on another topic (which was mentioned above)",

        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:44): the video codec situ seems quite messy",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:50): f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905: k. sounds like it would be reasonable for the microdata version to just say that a blank N is generated if it's missing, then, with no special magic to generate it from FN, NICK, and ORG like hCard",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:52): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, there are probably some cases where a blank n *should* be generated from fn, nickname, org etc., even in hCard",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:53): how do you mean?",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:54): that is there are some cases where hCard auto-generates a value for the 'n' property when it should probably generate an empty 'n' property",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:55): ah i see",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:55): I'm going to have to another round of tests with modern vcard consumers to understand the impact of various combinations of implying a blank 'n' vs an 'n' with a non-empty value.",

        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:56): Atom is actually much worse",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:56): a bunch of things are required, but there's no suggestion of what to do when they're unknown",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:56): so many really bad MUSTs on content authoring",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:56): and so many bad requirements for artificial precision - e.g. RFC3339",
