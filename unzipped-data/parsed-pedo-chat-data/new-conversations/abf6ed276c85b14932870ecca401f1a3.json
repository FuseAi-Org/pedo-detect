        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (17:56): i run shit on XEN0 like db, web server etc",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (17:56): why would i use 64 megs for it then?",

        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (17:57): ok then 64 is enough",
        "c0fcbff66aa9b9d17331a41ba44ec3b5 (17:57): I figured that most people would move all of their services into domU machines",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (17:57): mrEriksson: yes it can",

        "c0fcbff66aa9b9d17331a41ba44ec3b5 (18:00): Ok, still no luck with grub",
        "0ec644d47e44c42cf93652fb776bdf84 (18:05): zerotrace: hmm I never used grub (only bsd loader and lilo, other than a few commercial ones), but if you did a standard netbsd install, usually the netbsd boot loader is installed in wd0a, so probably that telling grub to just boot that partition would work (of course this implies that grub can deal with bsd labels)",
        "0ec644d47e44c42cf93652fb776bdf84 (18:06): if you installed grub though, it's probably because you also installed another OS and are dual-booting?  If so, wd0a really might not be it",
        "c0fcbff66aa9b9d17331a41ba44ec3b5 (18:07): phadthai: I'm not even getting that far with grub... The problem is that grub is hanging right after the MBR boots... I think it's having trouble finding the /grub directory, but I have no way of knowing as it's not throwing out an error... I'm trying to boot a xen kernel, then netbsd on top of that",
        "0ec644d47e44c42cf93652fb776bdf84 (18:07): ok",
        "ba1e7f35f4a7498cb44387faeb8ea7c2 (18:08): zerotrace: how did you install grub ? what FFS version do you have on your drive?",
        "c0fcbff66aa9b9d17331a41ba44ec3b5 (18:08): grub-install /dev/rwd0d",
        "c0fcbff66aa9b9d17331a41ba44ec3b5 (18:09): I have no idea what FFS version I'm running... It's a fresh install of NetBSD 3.0.1",
        "c0fcbff66aa9b9d17331a41ba44ec3b5 (18:09): I'm putting grub on a floppy now... I'm going to try booting off that",
        "c0fcbff66aa9b9d17331a41ba44ec3b5 (18:11): Interesting... grub-install core dumps with a floating point exception if I try to write to a floppy"
