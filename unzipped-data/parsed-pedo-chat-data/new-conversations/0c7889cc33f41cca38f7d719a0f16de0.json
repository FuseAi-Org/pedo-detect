        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:34): mhm",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:35): i dont do it that much but i do enjoy it",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:35): what do you fish for?",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:35): usually bluegills, bass, perch",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:36): thats cool. i ususally just fish for compliments at bars",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:37): lol and how does that go?",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:37): that depends on the bar.... if its a gay bar i might get asked where i got my shoes at, but thats more of a compliment to my shoes than to me",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:38): lol right",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:38): the question is which bar do you go to more often though... and where do you get better compliments",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:39): Well... the bars vary but the compliements have more to do with who gives them than where they are given",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:40): beggers cant be chosers i guess a compliment is a complment",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:41): yeah but no one wants the 90 yr old dykes compliment...",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:41): right but people still get it though lol",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:42): but is it still a compliment? it depends completely on the point of view of the reciever",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:44): it is in their mind however it might not be in yours but it matters what they compliment you for if it is actually you or something you are wear and so on",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:45): Yeah but thats more point of view. What person A says to person B may be meant by A as a compliement, but if B recieves it as a compliement is completely dependent on B. Thats all Im saying",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:45): right",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:46): do you like firelfies?",

        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:46): I was thinking the bug",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:47): they are an interesting creature so yeah",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:47): i think they are pretty as long as they dont try to land on me",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:47): but butterflies are evil",

        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:51): and the bible says butterflies are evil.",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:51): they spy on mankind for the devil and deliever forth their demonic vengence on us",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:51): and....",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:51): Yet... no one suspects them... which is a perfect cover.... too perfect",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:52): Your indifference suggests that perhaps you yourself are a hellspawn butterfly",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:52): i am",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:53): of course.... it makes perfect senese.... only a butterfly would enjoy night fishing for perch",

        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:54): and only you would talk about butterflies being hells eyes but in truth does it matter what a butterfly sees if it id sready known by god",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:55): of course it matters what a butterfly sees if it reports to the devil.",
        "ba7404fcf1c46475b9033409ad52b946 (05:55): so but think about this way god already knows that",
        "436205440b48c8b9d61f5124d10092db (05:56): so? the devil ends up better informed. how do you think obama got elected?",
