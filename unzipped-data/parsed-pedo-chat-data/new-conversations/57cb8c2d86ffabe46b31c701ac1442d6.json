        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:45): it would have been better if the HTMLWG just joined in here, since most (I think) of us in here are on the HTMLWG.",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (15:47): Or have the channel on this network, even if it was a different channel",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:48): oh wow, the topic of this channel just keeps growing :-)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:49): 5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67, will you be importing the logs from whatbot into your irc-logs server?  Then we can remove one of the URIs and redirect whatbot to your site",
        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:00): that would be better yes",

        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:01): it's just wasting bandwidth at the moment",
        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:01): i'll have to take down that server",
        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:01): so the previous logs will be lost",
        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:01): unless they can find a new home",
        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:01): they're just static files",
        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:01): so i'm sure i'll be able to upload them somewhere",
        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:02): it would of course be cooler if krijn can just import them all",

        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:06): i really wish we could just use UTC for absolutely everything",
        "ff64b22fba69b8e8c087e9af5279900c (16:06): even adjust our clocks to that",
