        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:49): Yes, since everyone defaults to JS",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (01:52): thx",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (01:53): it's very nice when writing tutorials to be able to drop all the BS extra voodoo characters normally used",
