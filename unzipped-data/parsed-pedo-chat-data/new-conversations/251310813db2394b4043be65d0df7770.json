        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:35): hey",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:40): hey 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e - do you know, or know someone who knows, or know somewhere I can find out information about youtube.com/html5 ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:41): what information?",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:41): HTTP requisites",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:41): not sure what you mean",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:41): I'm getting 403 on my experimental build of webkit",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:41): odd",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:41): so presumably there are requisite headers",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:41): 403 for the video file?",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:41): yes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:42): and it works for regular webkit?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:42): how weird",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:42): have you dumped the two network traffic sessions and compared them?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:42): i don't see why there'd be anything like that",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:42): this is a different multimedia backend",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:43): i'd recommend cracking out tcpdump and comparing them",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:43): hmm, ok",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:44): my thought is it's probably either a cookie it wants, or a missing refferer header",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:44): my backend passes on neither at the moment",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:45): anyway, I just thought you might have seen some documents floating around I could consult :)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:46): oh you almost certainly need the opt-in cookie",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:50): yeah, unfortunately the webkit interface for media is somewhat broken in this respect. The backend is only passed a URL to the media file.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:52): seriously, i'd recommend using tcpdump to see what the working UA is sending",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:52): it could be something obvious",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:52): a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5: we do want to eventually fix the networking to go through WebKit's http stick - just tricky to beat both WebKit and relevant media engines into shape",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:52): a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5: I think Referer or Cookie is a likely candidate",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:53): a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5: if you find the differences, one easy way to see which is making the difference could be to use curl or wget with custom headers",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:55): unfortunately I'm on linux atm, and HTML5 media support is in chrome (but not chromium) afaik",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:55): which leaves me with nothing to compare against",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (07:56): but a massive wget hack could work :P",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:07): there's no official Chrome for Linux yet?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:07): wait, WebKit/Gtk has video support - does that not work?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:07): (or is that what you are working on now?)",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (08:08): I'm working on WebKit/Qt",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:08): you could check if WebKit/Gtk can handle YouTube, that might be the easiest point of reference (though of course you'd need a GStreamer module that does H.264...)",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (08:09): yeah.. I have that",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (08:09): I'll investigate :)",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (08:11): also, it looks like there is an official chrome for linux now",
        "a13dd189d82538a3cf8f8e47d3b133a5 (08:28): dear lord, the GTK version explicitly spoofs its user agent for movies.apple.com"
