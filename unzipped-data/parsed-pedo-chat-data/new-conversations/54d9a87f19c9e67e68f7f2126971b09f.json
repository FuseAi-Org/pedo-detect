        "4a722ba9665fe3ebecdfcf04168ae596 (09:44): i spoke to matt (organizer of the js meetup) today and he wants to organize one in february. so if you want to talk, let me know",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:52): i'm about to go to bed, but i'll say hi at least 4a722ba9665fe3ebecdfcf04168ae596",
        "4a722ba9665fe3ebecdfcf04168ae596 (09:52): ohai",
        "4a722ba9665fe3ebecdfcf04168ae596 (09:52): sleep is for sissies",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:52): i know",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:52): consider me a girl",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:53): to make up for it, know that with curl and some preg_match, i can now decently effectively sniff for doctypes",
        "4a722ba9665fe3ebecdfcf04168ae596 (09:54): oh neat",
        "4a722ba9665fe3ebecdfcf04168ae596 (09:54): you earned 8 hours of sleep then, haha",
        "4a722ba9665fe3ebecdfcf04168ae596 (09:54): (sorry, i am intoxicated right now)",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:54): regex made me want to give myself a haircut",
        "bd31df6485a5054cf7eca3994c3cb897 (09:54): regular expressions would make anyone want to cut things",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:55): more or less, i have nested preg_matches",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:55): first one looks in a curl return of 150bytes for any instance of DOCTYPE",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:55): second one looks for &quot;html p&quot; with case insensitive searching",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:56): and since html5 doctype has &quot;html&gt;&quot;, it returns negative, and the rest return either no doctype or positive, and that's all i needed anyway",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:56): html5 vs the rest vs none",
        "bd31df6485a5054cf7eca3994c3cb897 (09:56): hm",
        "bd31df6485a5054cf7eca3994c3cb897 (09:57): why do you need to do that? if you write the doc you know what doctype it is",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:57): if anyone thinks of a better way, or perhaps a way to regex &quot;html&gt;&quot;, i'd greatly appreciate the string to use",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:57): but this is for an hcard plugin for wordpress, and i can't know who's going to use which",
        "bd31df6485a5054cf7eca3994c3cb897 (09:57): ohhh",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:58): general plan is...if html5 doctype, tack on the hcard profile link to the wp_head()",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:58): if not, leave a note somewhere saying to apply the profile link to the &lt;head&gt; tag",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (09:59): :D",
