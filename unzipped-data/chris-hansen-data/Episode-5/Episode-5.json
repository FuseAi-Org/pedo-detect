I don't see the internet in real life are two different things. What says on the internet doesn't mean that's what I really think.  \nSpeaker 0    00:14:32    Well, that would be easier to believe. Jeff, if you didn't show up here tonight where you thought a young girl was home alone. No,  \nSpeaker 18    00:14:39    I really didn't. Well, I knew she was alone. Why would you be here? I mean, I knew she was alone, but that doesn't mean much to me.  \nSpeaker 0    00:14:47    You're an adult. She's a child.",

He's just been convicted of attempting to solicit sex with a child.  \nSpeaker 21    00:27:23    So right before he has to go into jail next Thursday, he wants to come over and have sex with another minor or try.  \nSpeaker 0    00:27:30    He's talking about Kevin Westerbeck, the man with the bird on his head. Ironically, his screen name is changed for the better. 2006, a budget analyst for the military. He's been chatting with someone posing as a 13-year-old Virgin Corrine Destiny forever.  \nSpeaker 20    00:27:46    Would you get naked?

He asks the girl if she's a cop. Corin Destiny forever. One of many perverted justice members around the country working during this investigation says no way. Later in the chat under a different screen name Kevin West. He admits what we already know about him.  \nSpeaker 20    00:28:19    I did something stupid less than a year ago. So I went to court Friday about it. What you do? My attorney and I plead bargained this next Thursday. I go to jail for it, for it for 11 months. I got busted.

In respect to the courts, I'd ask for an no or because I'm going to jail on Thursday. Anyway.  \nSpeaker 25    00:38:48    I think I'll ensure that you make it back to Judge Rollovers court in Springfield. I'll set bail on 100,000 cash. Sure. To your property.  \nSpeaker 0    00:38:55    Since this first court appearance, a grand jury has indicted all 17 men and charged them with attempting unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. All pleaded not guilty except this man. No.  \nSpeaker 25    00:39:07    Have you contacted a lawyer? No. Do you plan to do so? No.  \nSpeaker 0    00:39:12    Alonzo Wade pleaded no contest. He was found guilty and is awaiting sentencing for many of these men. The trip from chatting about sex online to shuffling through the criminal justice system has been a long one.  \nSpeaker 24    00:39:26    A lot of thinking and planning goes into doing something like this.  \nSpeaker 0    00:39:31    Robert Weiss is the clinical director of a sexual addiction treatment center in Los Angeles. He explains the thought process through the eyes of a predator.  \nSpeaker 24    00:39:40    I didn't wake up one morning and say, I'm gonna do this today. I woke up five months ago or five years ago and said, boy, this looks kind of good to me. And I evolved down a road of eventually landing at that door set.  \nSpeaker 25    00:39:52    Where are you?  \nSpeaker 0    00:39:53    But Weiss says, not all these potential predators are alike. Some can be treated and some cannot. The first step for the kind of men caught in our investigation, Weiss says, is to admit they are sex offenders. And that's sometimes a tall order.  \nSpeaker 24    00:40:07    These guys need to say and understand that they have the potential to harm a child.",

I'm so stupid. I'm an idiot. Well, they feel stupid. They feel like idiots. But an idiot would not be able to carry out that degree of sophisticated planning and acting out. None of them are idiots. And that's the good news because in treatment they can be challenged, their thinking can be challenged.  \nSpeaker 0    00:40:39    For now, the fate of those men caught in our Ohio investigation is in the court's hands.  \nSpeaker 25    00:40:45    Okay, we'll be in recess. Thank you very much. Thank you, your  \nSpeaker 16    00:40:47    Honor.  \nSpeaker 0    00:40:49    But there are other sex predators in other states who are still on the loose.  \nSpeaker 25    00:40:53    Took a hard look.  \nSpeaker 0    00:40:55    Florida is a state with one of the highest numbers of registered sex offenders. In our next investigation will head south where we'll set up another undercover house, the setting for some very strange goings on. It's almost like we've entered a suspected cyber predator twilight zone. You wanna explain yourself. This man, for instance, he doesn't have any clothes on chocolate chip's. My favorite all this guy can talk about is the cookies left on the counter. Can I get you a glass of milk to go along with those cookies? Sure. This man improvises a disguise, but keeps right on talking.  \nSpeaker 27    00:41:30    Ain't nothing going on here dude. Nothing funny",

But most shocking of all our Florida suspects is this man, a 42-year-old father who's expecting to meet an underage boy at our house. Oh no. He's got his child with him. None of us can believe that. He's brought along his own five-year-old son. And since you have your child here, I'm not going to pursue this. I think it'd be best if you just went ahead and left. Yeah.

After years of being abused by his father, she was  \nSpeaker 29    00:43:04    Laying there completely naked. My dad, uh, striked up the torch and told me that I was gonna have sex with Reon.  \nSpeaker 4    00:43:13    The prosecution says that abuse never happened.
