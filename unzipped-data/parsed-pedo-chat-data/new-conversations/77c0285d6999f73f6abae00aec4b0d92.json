        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:21): anyone using iscsi?",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:24): i want to setup two 12TB dumb jbod arrays with zfs on two 1U servers (probably x4100), have each set of hardware in different buildings with iSCSI between for disk-to-disk",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:24): +backup",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:25): benr's your man. The iSCSI target has only just integrated, but the Initiator is in supported solaris 10",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (08:30): the initiator is the part that shares the space? and the target is the client (user of the space?)",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:30): other way around i think",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:31): initiator is the client",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (08:31): okay... its something i need to play with... when it gets to SXCR",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (08:31): so they targetted the initiator code first, before they initiated the work on the target?",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:31): well, better to have solaris as an iscsi compatible client",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:32): since most targets are dedicated iscsi hardware anyway",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:32): Doc:  once again an insightful and helpful comment :)",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:32): And yes, initiator is the client",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:32): ok then, what i want is not there yet",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:33): the dumb jbod is sata to FC, so I can just stick in a 2-4gb FC card",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (08:33): the whole concept of iSCSI just scares me",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:33): I don't get it either",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:33): gigE will suck, and they won't let me trunk, so i'll be stuck with gigE",

        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:33): What OS?",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:34): Both solaris?",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:34): so a 1u box running solaris 10 u2 in each building",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:34): with a 12tb jbod array attached with either iscsi or FC",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (08:34): iscsi sounds cool,   share  the space to another box and put zfs on top of it...",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:34): You could consider NFSv4. It will outperform iSCSI in many cases",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:34): yes, single gigE would be the only concern",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:35): Same prob either way with that though",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:35): but i'm already familiar with FC stuff, so i think it's the more mature option still",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:35): Some benchmarks show nfsv4 over 10GE outperforming FC",
        "6a1701c26b8df69203d2c816d5d613ed (08:36): yes well, benchmarks and cost are two different things :)",
        "d1ecb99b19140444b80e4035bfe0dd67 (08:36): Seems to me that iSCSI brings the worst of both worlds.. but that's a subject for a blog post",
