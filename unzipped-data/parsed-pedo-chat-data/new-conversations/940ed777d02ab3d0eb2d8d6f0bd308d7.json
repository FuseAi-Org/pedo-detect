Is that still accurate?",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (03:57): ref: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018888.html",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:09): 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: yes, though also add a less-dubious-than-abbr solution for microformats and microdata encoding dates",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:11): hixie: ok. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m curious about year and year-month. for adding to calendar, what about future dates which are not yet confirmed? eg 5 year plans",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:12): do you have an example of a page where it would be helpful for the user to be able to add a five-year plan to his calendar by clicking one thing on the page?",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:14): personally I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d like to add dates for future events I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m organising (Web Directions) to my calendar, but adding a day when they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re only accurate to a month seems like false detail.",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:14): current workaround is to add for the first of the month then try to remember what dates are set and which ones are vague",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:15): (these are on a private planning site)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:22): wouldn't it be more likely that you'd add those to the calendar before making a web page",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:31): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: there are several of us planning, plus others who need read/write or just read access. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m making a list of dates in the planning site, then we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re adding dates to a shared Google Calendar. However I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d also like to do this from HTML",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:33): you just want to add the dates? not event names, locations, etc?",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:33): (that way I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d only have to make the page with event info inc. microformatted dates, not add the events to a calendar plus make the page)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:39): i don't follow",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:40): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d like a list of events in a planning site, plus to be able to add them to a calendar. current process is create events in calendar plus create list on planning site. with microformats I could just do planning site then one-click to add to calendar",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:40): (the less time in iCal.app the better :/ )",
        "c92ee57335b2094856a53a7e2230b369 (04:48): sup?",

        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:50): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: for the 2nd point (automatic formatting to follow user conventions), in Japan it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s common to write dates with kanji separators; 2010\u00c2?\u00a58\u00ca\u00fa\u00e020\u00ca\u00f3\u2022. using time it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d be possible to do this automatically, but these also apply to year-month and year dates (eg weblog archive titles)",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (04:51): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: for the 3rd point (encode output of input element unambiguously) that should apply to year-month input too, no?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:09): 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: re your example, i don't see why you'd need anything new from &lt;time&gt; if you're going to use a microformat or microdata. For example, vEvent is based on dates as used with &lt;time&gt;, not months or years, iirc.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:10): 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: even for multi-day or -year events",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:10): 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: regarding your 2nd point, good to know.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:11): 1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f: regarding your 3rd point, i don't know; do people ever print the output of type=month in that way?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:11): the main use case for type=month is credit card expiry dates, but those get pretty printed easily as far as i can tell",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:12): no need for &lt;time&gt; for that",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:13): as in, sites just do printf &quot;%04d-%02m&quot;, $year, $month",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:13): or vice versa",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:13): it doesn't need anything complex",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:13): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: aah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:13): and might even actively not need anything complex, i dunno... how do japanese e-commerce sites echo expiry dates?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:13): what do japanese credit cards look like?",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:13): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m pretty sure I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve seen Japanese ecommerce sites that have the year as 2-digit",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:14): sure but do they have the kanji sepuarators?",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:14): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yeah, some Japanese credit cards have the expiry date as eg 10/15",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:15): (with English \u201a\u00c4\u00faMonth/Year\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 printed faintly above)",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:15): but then there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the whole Japanese year format thing\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 (wikipedia-ing\u201a\u00c4\u00b6)",

        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:27): actually it would be useful to use &lt;time datetime=&quot;1935&quot;&gt;\u00ca\u00f2?9\u00c2?\u00a5&lt;/time&gt; (the ninth year of the Sh?\u00e7wa era) as even Japanese people have trouble with this system outside of dates they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re familiar with. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got a free iPhone converter app for this :)",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:27): it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still used for eg driver\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s license DoB so not a historical thing yet",
