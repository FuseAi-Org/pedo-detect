        "d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9 (16:26): how many h1's per page?",
        "d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9 (16:26): 1 or n",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (16:31): well since articles and whatnot can now have them....",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (16:31): however, i think it's intended that at the root level of the page structure, only 1 h1",
        "d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9 (16:31): excellent, makes sense",
        "d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9 (16:31): the only discussion I saw in favor of using more was on multi-article pages",
        "c41d451ed773297423055eb1b05dcbd2 (16:33): but more than 1 validates",
        "d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9 (16:33): yeah just talking on a semantic level",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (16:33): structure matters",
        "c41d451ed773297423055eb1b05dcbd2 (16:33): how many h1s depends on the situation",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (16:35): reasons to not look at twitter today: vday gushing",
        "c41d451ed773297423055eb1b05dcbd2 (16:36): haha",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:36): d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9: h1 count definitely depends on the structure.  HTML5 allows infinite h1s",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:37): This may clash with search spiders, it may not",
        "d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9 (16:37): initially discussions i saw a year or two back had people citing Google that there should only ever be a single h1 on a page",
        "d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9 (16:37): but then the more recent discussions were one per article",
        "d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9 (16:37): no idea what Google thinks currently",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (16:37): google is always going to adapt their searching",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:37): d82591cb60e7235a0e396d1edf4638e9: That's not entirely true.  Google just wants to see a focused topic",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (16:38): i've seen quotes stating that they're going to see how people use the new tags and go based on that for adding meaning to them in their results",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:38): If your article's h1 is &quot;Food&quot;, and another few h1s &quot;Apples&quot;, &quot;Steak&quot;, &quot;Celery&quot;, Google will know this is a post about various food products",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (16:38): meaning, if we don't use those tags, their adaption will be slower",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:38): Then, of course, cross-linking plays into the equation",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:39): If you do the &quot;right&quot; thing, and have good content, you will be ranked well",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:39): Trust the system",
        "b249407c7dbfc4cfe2b81c3e2584cbed (16:44): I've got a div that's draggable, with 2 divs in it - is it possible to disable dragging when the second div is clicked?",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:50): b249407c7dbfc4cfe2b81c3e2584cbed: You can remove the event handler on the draggable element when the 2nd div is clicked",
        "b249407c7dbfc4cfe2b81c3e2584cbed (16:50): Tought of that workaround, but there is no native function to allow it to me?",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:52): Hmm, not that I'm aware",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:53): You might be able to leverage e.target in the dragging events",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:54): b249407c7dbfc4cfe2b81c3e2584cbed: Did you try this?",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:54): See if e.target within the dragging event matches the 2nd div, and then prevent the dragging from executing if that is the case",
        "bdedc97e25dde1328bae6e2d092691c8 (16:54): Could work",
        "b249407c7dbfc4cfe2b81c3e2584cbed (16:55): target is the main div",
        "b249407c7dbfc4cfe2b81c3e2584cbed (16:55): the container",
        "b249407c7dbfc4cfe2b81c3e2584cbed (16:55): is there something like e.originalEvent or something?",
        "b249407c7dbfc4cfe2b81c3e2584cbed (16:55): Because I think it's just cascaded to the container..",
