        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:04): relates how?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:05): ruby renders the annotation by default and abbr doesn't, is the main difference",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (10:05): well, if you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re adding ruby to an abbreviation, then I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m guessing that you could also wrap the ruby word in abbr",
        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (10:06): but the abbr title text would duplicate the rt text, so maybe not necessary",
