        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:23): yes, we know. They were mentioned here earlier",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:23): you may have to raise the bar a little for posting through that form to help prevent spam",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:23): like requiring people to be logged into the spec annotation system",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:23): or forwarding them to bugzilla to complete the bug report",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:25): Yay, I hope this now means we can move onto discussing something else for a while",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:25): Yeah, like @alt",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (02:25): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: exactly the thought I had",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:25): no",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:26): I expect we'll get a discussion about longdesc again shortly",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (02:27): longdesc=&quot;&quot; is so bad it almost makes summary=&quot;&quot; look useful",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:28): Want to make a bet, f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:28): First thread with at least 10 posts, alt or longdesc",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:29): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, as long as you promise not to cheat by sending 9 responses to the first mention of alt :-)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:29): My reputation would only harm the cause if I did, so no",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:30): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: the spec annotation system requires them to have sent feedback already, so that somewhat defeats the point of getting people who haven't sent feedback",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:30): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: and i can't redirect them to bugzilla if they haven't got an account yet, which seems likely",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:30): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, is the summary attribute explicitly excluded from the table elements' Content Attributes?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:31): yeah, because if we include it it'd have to say something about being discouraged, and we're avoiding saying anything bad about summary=&quot;&quot; lest the attribute or its friends be offended",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:32): what about letting logged in users have their bugs filed immediately, and others held for moderation (perhaps posted into IRC by a new IRC bot first, and allowing anyone in here to moderate it",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:32): I think you could list it and just link to the section about it at the bottom",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:32): but I don't think it's a big deal either way (at least to me)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:32): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: write me a moderation system and i'll get right on that",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:33): but that requires me to do work",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:33): but I'll think about it. I'd like to learn how to write an IRC bot one day, and this could give me a good excuse",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:34): if you have somewhere to host it, mozbot is a great bot infrastructure that lets you write new modules easily.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:34): and i don't say that just cos i wrote it :-P",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:35): what's it written in?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:35): or what does it require the modules to be written in?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:35): perl and perl",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:35): damn.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:36): I will find somewhere to host it",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:37): I wonder if my other web host, A Small Orange, will allow me to run IRC bot from there?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:37): IIRC, Dreamhost doesn't allow that",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:40): Do it as a mIRC script",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:40): does that mean I would have to be running mIRC?",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:43): like people with cognitive disabilities",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:44): I'm not sure what to say exactly. It might be better to get advice about this from someone who knows more about different types of disabilities than I do",
