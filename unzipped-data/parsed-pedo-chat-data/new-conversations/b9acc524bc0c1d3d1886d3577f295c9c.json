        "01dfc3bbee6738f38a06f534972e5445 (04:45): the firewire cable's head looks like a usb head, correct? cuz I see two connectors on the board and I have two extra separate usb for a total of eight... but now Im thinking i connect the firewire to one of the usb connectors on the board minusing two usbs...",
        "debf42d77bb9315f721d2ef6f22c1bd2 (04:45): yeah released today",

        "9c98af909f1130c4e56eda05bbfca225 (04:50): Should say in the manual or somewhere",

        "9c98af909f1130c4e56eda05bbfca225 (04:52): then I'd guess they're both USB",
        "01dfc3bbee6738f38a06f534972e5445 (04:53): but the mobo supports firewire and I don't see another connector that's similar in head type",
