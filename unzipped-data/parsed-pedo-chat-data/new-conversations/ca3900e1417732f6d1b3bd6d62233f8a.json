        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (14:57): whats new?",
        "9195ddae0b0d38a9c2fd1e0381edbd48 (14:59): Tenkawa: Apple have released OSX for generic X86 systems",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:00): RichardP_: I may be tired but I'm not THAT tired",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:00): w00t!  today i realized that templated functions in C++ work!  i tried that a year ago, and it didn't work... i had to do some stupid ass hack to make it work",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:00): and i just find that awfully useful :)",
        "9195ddae0b0d38a9c2fd1e0381edbd48 (15:01): heh",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:01): Vratha: thats odd.. I was using them 7 years ago in c++",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:01): couldnt tell you how to use them now but I could then",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:01): Tenkawa: templated functions?  as far as i know, a lot of compilers didn't support that correctly",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:01): you had to do some weird hack using a struct",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:02): i got that hack in some code of mine around here somewhere",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:02): Vratha: that could be possible. We were using HP-UX and STL stuff to do it",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:02): yeah",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:02): maybe your compiler was better",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:02): all i know is that it works in VS 2005 and GCC; so, i'm happy about that",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:02): yeah it was a pretty nice compiler (for 7 years ago standards anyway)",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:02): :)",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:02): yeah",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:03): RichardP_: can you imagine the thunderous effect that would resonate through the tech world if that happened?",
        "9195ddae0b0d38a9c2fd1e0381edbd48 (15:05): Tenkawa: yes :)",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:06): RichardP_: I know about 5 machines of my own that would be converted within the day",
        "d410a2373acf060b30a7f1a1109d639d (15:08): hello",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:08): hi",
        "d410a2373acf060b30a7f1a1109d639d (15:08): is there any way on the net I can view the socket.h of darwin/macosX?",
        "9195ddae0b0d38a9c2fd1e0381edbd48 (15:11): Almindor: yes, theres an opensource repository iirc",
        "d410a2373acf060b30a7f1a1109d639d (15:13): RichardP_, all I found was a huge all in one package of sources, but I'd love a svn or cvs from http access for thios",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:16): oh, got StarFox Command this evening... great game so far",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:17): been playing it on multiplayer mostly so far... good shit",
        "d410a2373acf060b30a7f1a1109d639d (15:17): nevermind one guy pasted it for me",
        "d410a2373acf060b30a7f1a1109d639d (15:17): thanks",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:18): if any of you in here get that game and wanna play head-on, let me know.. we can exchange friend codes",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:21): Vratha: gamecube right?",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:23): DS",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:23): game came out one week ago... but it's SO FUN",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:23): way better than metroid prime hunters",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:23): which i found rather annoying",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:23): oh",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:24): how do you do multiplayer? with the usb attachment?",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:24): I have a ds and the addon for it",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:24): or do you just play it with proximity multiplayer?",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:25): the DS has wifi built into it.. you just connect to a router and hop onto nintendo's network",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:25): but you can also play within proximity",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:25): proximity play is best, b/c you can play with 5 other people",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:25): over the internet you can only play with one other person",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:25): is this a new ds model because I dont recall mine having it",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:25): no, i have the original DS.. they all have wifi",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:25): and what wifi security does it suppot",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:25): er suppor",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:26): i don't recall; i don't use wifi security",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:26): oh",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:26): I'm using as much as I can but there are about 15 AP's within contact of me",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (15:26): so its kinda needed",
        "5f3f3f58d83afac58433711ababf86ed (15:27): at some point this christmas i'll setup my network with VPNs to make it more secure, but for now i just rely on SSL and SSH",
