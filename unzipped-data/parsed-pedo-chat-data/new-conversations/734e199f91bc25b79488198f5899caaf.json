        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (06:57): how are you today ?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:58): so, regarding http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7546#c10, &quot;HTML 5 being superseded by CCN or a similar structural change&quot;, anybody know what &quot;CCN&quot; is?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (06:59): d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad: I am doing swimingly",

        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:00): i am looking for someone who can design a site for me :)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:00): content-centric networking",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:01): d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad: I think this would probably not be the best place to look",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:01): there are not so many designers here",
        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:01): any suggestions ?",
        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:02): i do not know web building",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:02): d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad: how much would you be able to pay somebody to design the site?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:22): it seems that CCNx is the more common abbreviation for content-centric networking these days",
        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:23): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:24): yeah",
        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:24): depends on what they ask",
        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:24): lol",
        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:24): i am fair guy",
        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:24): and what they can offer",
        "d36632a49b3f4755448b758ae048bfad (07:24): just NO Flash",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:33): what is CCN?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:33): as in, what does &quot;content centric networking&quot; actually mean",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:35): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: yeah, though not clear how it'd ever &quot;supersede&quot; HTML5",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:35): whether it would or not, I am now curious what it means",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:35): I seriously have no idea",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:35): it is not a term I have heard before",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (07:36): guesses it's the supposedly next term after DHTML, AJAX, HTML5",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:38): from googling, it sounds considerably lower level than HTML5",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:38): sounds like it is more a replacement for TCP/IP",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:39): yeah",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:39): (though I am still not sure what it is exactly)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:41): Hixie: I would like to bring http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9178 to your attention",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:41): request for Noah/TAG : add definition of &quot;conforming document&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:42): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7034 is one I raised but I'm not quite sure where we're at with it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:43): it really seems like a meta-issue, not a request for a specific change to the spec",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:43): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: where I'd like to be at with it is one or more bugs that propose specific changes to conformance requirements",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:43): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I don't like having this open-ended bug where everyone commenting has a different idea of what it means",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:44): yeah",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:44): &quot;remove all document conformance requirememts",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:44): &quot; would be a very clear bug",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:44): but if this bug ever represented that request, then Sam has apparently repurposed it for something different",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:45): Larry also made yet another different request",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:46): and there's all the old history",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:46): what that bug started out as was 'change &quot;conformance checker&quot; to &quot;ideology checker&quot; or &quot;loyalty checker&quot;'",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:46): yeah, which was kind of a joke",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:46): then at least some people supported removing all document conformance requirements as a serious idea",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:47): If I were to close it myself at this point, I guess somebody else would likely just re-open it",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:47): now Sam seems to be proposing some set of adding requirements, removing requirements, and making requirements optional",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:48): if you feel Sam's request differs from yours, you could work with him to put it in one or more other bugs, or you could go ahead and let him repurpose the bug",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:48): the biggest thing I'd worry about is if multiple people try to repurpose the bug, all for different purposes",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:54): I would prefer to remove myself as the reporter of that bug, but I guess there's no way to do actually do that",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:55): not without hacking the database",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:56): btw it looks like moving all those bugs to VERIFIED has been successful at getting issues to move to either CLOSED or REOPENED instead of languishing at RESOLVED",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:56): which makes me happy",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:57): we're up to 325 CLOSED, where yesterday I think we were around 270",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:58): I just closed all of the ones I had reported",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (07:59): except for two",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (07:59): I did all of mine except one",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:00): we still have a backlog of 1278 bugs in RESOLVED or VERIFIED",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:01): of which 34 are marked with TrackerIssue or TrackerRequest",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:01): so there's clearly a big backlog of bugs that haven't gotten a reply from the originator",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:01): thanks for doing your part to reduce that number",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:09): I actually didn't do all mine.. the two I have not closed yet are 7034 (the one we were just discussing) and 9178 (add definition of &quot;conforming document&quot;)",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (08:16): http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/2292/smurfperception.png",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (08:20): opps, meant that for the ot",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (08:26): 9178 is still NEW, so that's not an issue"
