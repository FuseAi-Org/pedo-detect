        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:10): seems related to issue 41",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:11): what problem would it solve?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:11): i don't understand",

        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:11): That framework implements a large number of custom widgets and attributes and uses post processing to fill it the DOM nodes",

        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:13): Less about what problem it solves, but the framework works fine in every browser using that notation.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:13): that's not html",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:13): it's just a proprietary language",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:13): So not specifying it seems to deny what browsers already support",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:13): so what html says doesn't seem very relevant",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:14): the rules for parsing that into the DOM structure shouldn't be specified though?",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:14): if browsers already handle it consistently",

        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:16): The lead developers on that project were asking me about conformance, and I was looking for relevant parts of the spec",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:17): it's not conforming -- it's not html at all",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:17): there's no &quot;tag prefix&quot; in &lt;ng:foo&gt;, the element is just called &quot;ng:foo&quot;",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:19): What do the parsing rules say about : in the name?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:19): nothing, it's treated the same as &quot;a&quot;",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:21): So then as far as the parser is concerned it's just an unknown element and is inserted into the DOM?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:21): yes",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:22): perfect, thanks",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:23): it might be worth putting something to that effect into the spec near the section on namespaces",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:23): prefix:something is not a namespace, just an known element with name &quot;prefix:something&quot;",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:28): well they're not allowed in either case, so it's not clear what good it would do to mention them",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:28): but i'll file a bug to think about it",

        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:28): They were really confused by the line 'The HTML syntax does not support namespace declarations, even in foreign elements.'",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:28): and thanks again, night",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:29): what's confusing about it?",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:31): They noticed that &lt;foo:bar&gt; is treated the same in most/all browsers in terms of DOM construction and parsing",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:31): but then that line seems like a confirming HTML5 browser should not permit it at all",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:31): so's &lt;fooxbar&gt;",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:31): the browser doesn't permit or deny anything",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:31): right, but the : confuses XML namespaces",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:32): so immediately they, and I, looked all over the spec at all sections that mention the word namespace",
