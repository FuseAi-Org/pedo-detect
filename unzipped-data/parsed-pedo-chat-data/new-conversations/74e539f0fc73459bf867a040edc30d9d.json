        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (12:59): bleh. rss-public is trying to work out Dave Winer's intent of a statement in RSS 2.0, for the purposes of clarifying the spec",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:59): lol",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:00): looking at specs is so the wrong way to solve actual problems (most of the time)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:00): &quot;A RSS feed may contain elements not described on this page, only if those elements are defined in a namespace.&quot; \u201a\u00c4\u00ee\u00ac\u2020are you allowed namespaced attributes on core elements?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (13:00): And the RSS &quot;specs&quot; make HTML 4.01 look well-defined",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:01): Something with my entities stuff is messed up",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:01): bah",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:01): Rogers Cadenhead has cited several other things that Dave Winer said  on the subject matter, which say yes in answer to that question.",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:18): ooh, that's like constitutional interpretation",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:18): Going just by the spec = strict constructionist",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:18): Researching Dave's other writings = original intent",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:21): But one thing I learnt in legal history class is that for interpretive purposes, you shouldn't rely on the writings of any legal authority until they've died",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:21): because if they're still alive, they might change their mind",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:21): hmm, I hope you're not suggesting killing Hixie after HTML5 goes Rec :)",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:22): No, I'm suggesting that we go by what the spec says rather than by what he posts elsewhere",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:23): though of course he's free to update the spec :-)",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:23): you must admit, it would make a good crime thriller episode if spec authors mysteriously started disappearing :)",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:23): This principle is also known as &quot;I would also like to thank Ian Hickson for reminding the world that the things I write in this weblog are not spec text.&quot;",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:23): ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2: even if the writings both predate and postdate (is that a word?) the spec?",

        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:25): Or produce errata, and say &quot;we comply with spec X with errata Y&quot;.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:26): ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2: that's the issue \u201a\u00c4\u00ee are they just updating the spec in such a way it is merely a clarification?",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:27): I don't really care about this particular example",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (13:27): RSS 2.0 is such a disaster zone I want to avoid thinking about it",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:28): it's used in the real world. as implementors, we need to implement it",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:28): (and fix the spec)",

        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:30): not really a problem for #whatwg then, I meant :)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:31): true, but there are others here who implement RSS :P",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:32): maybe it would have been easier if RSS has used HTML based markup instead of trying to corrupt XML",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:33): that's not the issue with RSS, the issue is how vague the spec is",
