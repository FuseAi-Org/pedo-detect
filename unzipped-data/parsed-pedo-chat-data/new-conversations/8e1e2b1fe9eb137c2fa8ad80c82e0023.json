He is trying to login to a windows machine onto the samba/windows domain that is controlled by the samba linux machine but he cannot. However he can login through konqueror's smb:// and also through a local account on a windows machine and then by giving \\\\sambaName or \\\\fqdn . Any ideas why he can't login directly through the windows login page?"
