        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (19:38): removed html:role, added &lt;svg:* role=&quot;&quot; aria-foo=&quot;&quot;&gt;. removed some notes",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (19:41): now i need to update the test cases...",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (19:59): updated the test cases at http://simon.html5.org/test/aria/role/",

        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:12): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: why would svg need aria- for aria?",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:13): when it has namespaces?",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:13): are we proposing only supporting aria- and not aaa: ?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:14): yeah",
        "944facfeb153b4f01916a0f166fcc315 (20:15): yeah.",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:15): so we're trying to kill the need for namespaces in aria at all",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:15): yes",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:15): fine, but, doesn't that need to be in the svg spec?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:16): it's a standalone proposal",
        "944facfeb153b4f01916a0f166fcc315 (20:16): I still hold to my moderate-strength objection - it seems goofy to prefix one attribute with aria- and not another, and it seems like that limits the applicability (because the language can't use &quot;role&quot; then).",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:16): 944facfeb153b4f01916a0f166fcc315, my argument about that before was that role= denotes the widget where aria-* denotes the state",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:17): but I don't really care",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:17): i don't care that much but time is short for me on this release",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (20:17): 7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45: just as much as it needs to be in the html spec",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:17): i think i need to see that the svg group is on board with it before i code it up, but it's cool with  me",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (20:18): the proposal came from the svg group unless i'm mistaken",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:18): k",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:18): i need to go for a minute",
        "7e2617a66594d8932013a5022b280c45 (20:18): but i'll catch up on it later",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:18): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: is the proposal coming from there a matter of public record somewhere?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:19): there's some discussion on www-svg",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:21): so is the time ripe for tackling xlink:href? ;-)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (20:22): if they prefer role=&quot;&quot; over html:role=&quot;&quot; ... :)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:22): it has to happen at some point",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (20:23): though xlink:href is interoperable in svg... no?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:23): yeah",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (20:23): but i guess UAs can support both href and xlink:href for some time",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:24): I would imagine a solution where you can specify both href=&quot;&quot; and xlink:href=&quot;&quot; where the latter would take precedence",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:24): IIRC back in April, xlink:href didn't quite work in WebKit",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:24): that is, if backwards compat is desired, otherwise href= would prolly take precedence",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:25): hmm, TAG discussed how people should write HTML",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:25): 73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46: the CC badge in http:/ b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker.xhtml is not clickable in WebKit",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:31): what Raman says about scripting and well-defined has been fixed as of HTML5 hasn't it?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:31): yeah",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:31): maybe he means it's ugly",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:31): it can be ugly but well-defined",
        "944facfeb153b4f01916a0f166fcc315 (20:32): (sorry in a meeting) - I just meant if we have an un-prefixed attribute directly in HTML5, then we own the semantics of that attribute - so ARIA can't change it later, and we might add things to it for other HTML uses.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:33): 944facfeb153b4f01916a0f166fcc315, yeah, I suppose that's true, although in practice I would expect the WG to evaluate such additions based on existing content and implementations",
