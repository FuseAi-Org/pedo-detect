        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:51): Cryo, it works from both manually send email and from mail4.zoneedit.com (secondary MX)",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:51): only mail that doesn't get delivered is from the primary MX (mail3.zonnedit.com)",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:51): so my virtual conf is fine",

        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:53): I did, they were like &quot;blah it works when you telnet to mail3, so there it no problem&quot;",
        "a7249565f480308e64f52a18cedf8978 (02:53): so the problem is... mail3 and not your end?",

        "a7249565f480308e64f52a18cedf8978 (02:57): dynamic?",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:57): yeah",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:57): got ifwatchd update my A Record when the ip changed",
        "a7249565f480308e64f52a18cedf8978 (02:57): there are a lot of MXs that will reject you because of that.",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:57): the DNS host is the same as the MX host",
        "a7249565f480308e64f52a18cedf8978 (02:57): like.. mine.",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:57): and they specifically allow that",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:57): and as I said, it works fine on the second MX (which is the same host)",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:58): they even allow delivering to non standard ports (which is what I use)",
        "a7249565f480308e64f52a18cedf8978 (02:58): ah, ok.  I didn't see anything obviously wrong, so I still point my finger at mail3.",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:58): so do I and another guy",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:58): I already mailed them once but they were like &quot;manually sending email works so it's not on our end&quot;",
        "a7249565f480308e64f52a18cedf8978 (02:58): of course not",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:59): I just sent them a more detailed report with the logs and dumps",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (02:59): hopefully they'll investigate a little further",
        "a7249565f480308e64f52a18cedf8978 (03:00): good luck with that",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (03:00): as my friend's saying... it's either that or mail3 and mail4 aren't running the same version of Postfix and postfx as a deep implementation issue that only affects connections from these two version",
        "334980e1e056773993bf52426a66cdc9 (03:00): btw regarding dynamic IPs, that's the whole point of using them as an MX, so that I don't get blacklisted and all (and also bypassing my isp that blocks port 25)",
