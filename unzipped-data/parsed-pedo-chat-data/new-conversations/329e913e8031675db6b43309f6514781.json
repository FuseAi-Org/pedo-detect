        "6a169a184be52679d47463b96b08b3de (21:39): SpComb, sending it would cost more than it itself",
        "6a169a184be52679d47463b96b08b3de (21:40): are there any dutch people in here? if yes..... do you guys know where i can buy a good motherboard for a nice price? ;)",

        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (21:56): if cat6 is only like $20/roll more than 5e",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (21:56): go for it",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (21:56): better shape for gigE",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:03): so making a cable yourself is cheaper?",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:03): take the connectors into account",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:04): and the number of failed connetors that you have to recrimp",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:04): I think ready cables are cheaper than making cables yourself",
        "c72dbdf529e69c1ae3fed7f262edaa92 (22:04): $5/each connections $250 tossed in the trash plus most of them never worked right for 3 yrs and almost drove him to sucide tryign to keep the network going",
        "1696cea4415357644bc5c59cb6ba636a (22:04): SpComb: I've never had failed connectors when crimping with my big side cutters",

        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:08): also consider the quality of the cable... ready cables usually have some sort of sleeve on the connector that makes it quite nice",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:08): that's 33 cents per connector",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:08): they don't sell cable here, so I don't know about that",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:09): but if we approximate 50 pence to be 50 cents... a 1m cable is 50 + 2*33 &gt;&gt; 74",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:09): there's a very clear price difference there",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:10): SpComb: if you buy 20m of cable it is however when you buy a 150m roll of cable it isn't 50p/m is double the cable cost!",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:10): huh?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:10): and also throw away your little exchange rate tool dude! it's usless",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:10): well, the cable would have to be about 10 cents/m for it to be cheaper than the ready-made one",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:11): I'm approximating downwards",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:11): I know 50p &gt; 50c",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:11): and I'm not going to throw my head anywhere",

        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:14): but 100 connectors wouldn't work for normal use, a bit too many connectors",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:14): I'd say that for e.g. home use ready-made cables are definatly cheaper...",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:14): dunno, I was just wondering how ready-made cables stood up to making them yourself",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:15): also, if you are wiring up for a company, you also have to take in labour costs...",
        "bab5d1733bee9596ea76260696246f5e (22:15): somehow I think ready made cables win",
