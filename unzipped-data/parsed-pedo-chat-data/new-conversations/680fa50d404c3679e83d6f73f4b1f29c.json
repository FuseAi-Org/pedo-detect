        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (11:49): using a poorly documented and generally crap message passing system that's built on the principle of &quot;more threads are better&quot;",

        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (11:54): but it's some kind of component architecture too, and too much of our app is built as &quot;active message passing components&quot;",
        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (11:54): i know i could do it in 25% of the code using qcore",
