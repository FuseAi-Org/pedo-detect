        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:42): i'm confused because he immediately sent another e-mail asking questions",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:42): and i don't know if he wants me to reply or not",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:43): probably safest not to",

        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:43): So the way I read it is",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:43): hmm. I read it as shut up too",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:44): &quot;80% is an argument that you always use, I'm not convinced by it, save it for later.&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:44): it wasn't intended to be an argument",

        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:45): not dispute",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:45): right, it wasn't intended to be a point of discussion -- it's just how languages have to be designed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:45): you always have to draw a line as to how much to include",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:45): it's not clear to me that there can be useful perspectives where you don't draw a line",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:47): though i'd love to hear of one if there are some",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:47): of course the line has to be drawn somewhere, it's just a matter of finding out wheere",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:47): imagine a line based on the inclusion of diversity more than the democracy (democracy being the power of the majority as opposed to the Republics without entering too much into details)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:47): what do you mean by &quot;diversity&quot;?",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:48): we are drifting... but let's say. For example, the republics guarantee the rights of minority because the respect of this diversity is important for the design of a society.",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:48): Democracies at the opposite impose the power of big numbers on minority",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:48): usually a mix of the two is useful.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:48): ok... (looking for how this applies to language design)",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:49): accessibility for example, or internationalisation.",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:50): a feature can be useful for a limited number of persons, but without the feature, the language will not be useful in this precise context.",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:50): Same for the inclusion of some rare characters in unicode.",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:51): suddenly remembers how much usenet sucks when we could not type accents typing French.",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:52): When some people started to mention that it would be cool to modify the implementation. Some people said it was folly.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:53): 67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a, I don't understand the point you are trying to make. I thought you were trying to explain a perspective where a line doesn't have to be drawn, but then you gave an example where it was drawn in a different place.",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:54): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I just said there is not one unique line, I said it was a question of perspective, point of view. :)",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:54): being binary doesn't help",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:55): well sure, my point was just that you do have to draw a line",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:55): which you seem to agree with, despite saying earlier that that was just &quot;in my perspective&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:56): is now confused as to both karl's opinion _and_ leif's opinion!",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:57): I understand Lief's opinion, he just objects to the 80%-20% argument because he sees it as a way to ignore the minority, particularly on accessibility",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:57): ooo, yet another mailing list",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:58): your line is 80/20 rationale. what I said being your perspective :)",

        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:58): you decided to draw the line on this principle",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:58): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yes, a lot of people do misunderstand it",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (05:59): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: because it is often used not only to categorize data, but to remove options to people.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (05:59): some don't realise that it's not a fixed ratio either, it needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis depending on numerous other factors",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:00): what's the status of the design proposals? can i add one?",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:00): maybe, what are you thinking of adding?",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (06:00): So I guess each time we categorize data like this, we have to propose something that will not exclude people falling into the 20%.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:00): people don't fall into percentages",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:01): it's 80% of _content_, not 80% of _users_",

        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (06:01): pretty sure",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:02): i'm just talking about language design here",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:02): and in designing languages for the web, we should aim to cater for 100% of users, and n% of use cases, where n &lt; 100.",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (06:02): yes but people are &quot;humans&quot; not machines. When they read something, they charge it with emotions, etc. The same way you read leif comment with emotions.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:02): lachy: (that's the principle i was going to add)",
        "67ab482559bf3f830bdf948ab892778a (06:03): so when you say 80% of something, many people will think 20% of people",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:03): if people aren't going to read what i write, that's not really my problem",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:07): no big loss to me, since someone who doesn't slow down long enough to actually read what they're talking about probably isn't going to be slowing down long enough to think about what they're writing either.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:08): exactly! It's more productive to not respond in some cases",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:09): and just hope that, eventually, people get the idea that unproductive, emotionally charged responses don't get responses, and then they stop sending them",
