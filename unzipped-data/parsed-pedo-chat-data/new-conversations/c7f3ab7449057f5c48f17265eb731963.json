        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:13): it has advantages and disadvantages, sure",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:14): well, convincing henri is both sufficient and necessary, so probably, yes :-)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:14): disadvantages include the issues he listed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:14): like being able to take svg and put it in html and just have it work",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:16): the SVG WG says a lot of things",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:17): there's plenty of scripts that say &amp;gt; instead of &gt; and similar, deep inside a for loop",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:18): i'm sure authors would just put up with it if we made it so that such scripts would need changing",

        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (01:18): likewise they'd put up with it if they have to adjust the script when copy-pasting",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:18): also, we'd have to change the CDATA thing",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:18): anyway, as you said earlier, i'm not really the one to convince",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:20): (another difference would be comment parsing inside scripts, i wonder how many svg files have commented-out content in &lt;script&gt; blocks)",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (01:21): well.. i suspect that the SVG WG has a lot more experience looking at the markup that various tools output",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (01:21): and so far most of the SVG which is generated, is generated using tools i bet",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:22): usually inkscape, sometimes Illustrator",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:23): I'm not convinced that just dropping SVG into HTML would necessarily work",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (01:23): especially when scripts are involved",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (01:23): since the DOM will be very different",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:23): not even all SVG content generated by Inkscape or Illustrator works in browsers",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (01:23): the &lt;svg&gt; element won't be the documentElement for example",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:24): yes, a lot of SVG with script assumes that SVG is the root",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:24): right",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:24): not sure who said it would just work...",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:24): but I'm on the SVG WG, and I'm not at all confident about that",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:27): 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6: a number of reasons were given, such as making sure that errors made in editing SVG in HTML wouldn't be accepted and thus &quot;corrupt&quot; the pristine SVG ecosystem, and making it possible for output from SVG tools could be dropped straight into HTML files without work.",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:27): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: yes, I think that was a reasonable request",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:27): I don't know for a fact that that was accomplished, either in the HTML5 spec or in implementations",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:28): at least the second part of that is only reasonable if one is confident that SVG content dropped into HTML would in fact just work",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (01:28): there's also author education around how to write the script correctly such that it doesn't break\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 but that's not really an authoring tool issue, unfortunately\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 not many good tools for scripting SVG",
