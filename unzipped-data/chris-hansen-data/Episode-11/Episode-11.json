The Dateline piece is probably done more than any law we can create  \nSpeaker 3    00:40:14    As the Petaluma Police book, the last of the men arrested in this operation, the total number of suspected sex predators exposed by Dateline over two years rises to 179.

The issue of online sexual misconduct has been in the spotlight in Washington for a whole different reason. Congressman Mark Foley, the man who championed the Child Protection Act of 2006, resigned after inappropriate emails and instant messages surfaced that he sent to former congressional pages. Ironically, last February, Foley went on Scarborough Country on M-S-N-B-C to talk about this very issue. Hey  \nSpeaker 27    00:41:03    Mark. Are you telling me that courts in this country are saying it's a pervert's? Right? To send an email to a 14-year-old kid?  \nSpeaker 25    00:41:12    We have been foiled, if you will, by the courts repeatedly by using the First Amendment and people's right to have free speech. That's why we tried to toughen the laws. That's why we tried to create a more difficult time for predators to roam free.  \nSpeaker 3    00:41:28    And Foley even praised Dateline.  \nSpeaker 25    00:41:31    The Dateline piece is probably done more than any law we can create.
