        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:29): can be",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:29): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, it's not that important, but I was wondering about your proposal on the appformats list",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:29): anything specific?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:29): is  Access-Include-Credentials provided by the UA or the server?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:29): and what are the header values?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:30): server",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:30): (your proposal says UA, but I expect server)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:30): no values (or just &quot;yes&quot; or something)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:31): GET requests would always work?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:31): or would GET requests need to be preceded by a normal request too?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:36): GET requests work like now but without credentials, and if the server replies with an Access-Include-Credentials they are redone with credentials",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:36): :(",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:37): can the user be prompted in the initial request?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:45): the user can never be prompted can he?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:47): guess so",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:47): &lt;img src=cross-site&gt; is prompted iirc",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:48): i don't think we should ever prompt the user for credentials in any request that will be subject to Access-Control management",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:50): so you'd just get a 403 back (or 401?) and be done with it?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:50): i guess that's ok",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:52): (that is of course, if the server actually provides Access-Control headers with the 401)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:55): makes sense to get back the 401",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (10:56): i hope browsers implement that too as I think it's useful",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:59): the main advantage is taht it might get us out of this deadlock",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:00): I don't see how it adds any security",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:00): it wouldn't defend against anything that anyone has identified as a threat model",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:01): The only threat model I've seen so far is that people might opt in too soon and others would copy and paste and only Firefox users would be vulnerable",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:02): I have not followed the appformats list though",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:02): But Access-Include-Credentials doesn't address that issue",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:02): and that is deadlocking mozilla",
