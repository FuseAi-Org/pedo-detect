        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (21:27): which?",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (21:27): I mean do the same thing with the declarations as we do for atoms",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (21:28): I'd be totally fine with that",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (21:28): so instead of several arrays / enums for role types you'd have",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (21:28): ROLE(BUTTON, IA!_BUTTON, ATK_BUTTON, &quot;button&quot;)",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (21:29): ok, I think I'll file bugs then",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (21:30): wait",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (21:30): ok",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (21:30): i'll check the bugs to be sure i understand.",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (21:30): I'm not in any real hurry",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (21:30): go ahead",

        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (21:30): bugs are cheap",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (21:31): ok",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (21:32): but it really is the same thing we do with atoms modulo the exact definitions of the macro and how many arguments it takes",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (21:33): anyway, I'm going to go eat then start landing stuff then deal with other stuff",

        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (22:12): ok, I'd consider calling it a good first bug, but dealing with cpp can get interesting if things don't go as expected",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (22:12): davidb: but I might see if I can just write a patch tonight",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (22:13): sweet!",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (22:13): well, actually I should land the roles patch first of course :)",

        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (22:32): but I think fiddling with flags if they don't mean anything confuses things",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (22:32): oh is that what happened?",

        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (22:33): if anyone was confused in that case, but I believe it to be a risk",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (22:33): oh, perhaps it had an r+ with no name next to it?",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (22:33): it is too bad bugzilla doesn't solve this\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 make it clear about the status of the patch in terms of land-ability",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (22:34): I guess? but then it would have to know who can review what",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (22:35): but otherwise why can't we just use r+ to mean can land?",
        "906cca2a5ed603c0f4e8b08b56a80768 (22:36): because we want to encourage reviews",
        "94d50e2efa8ecc99acd742d7cdd18f4a (22:36): not actually land, but &quot;I would be ok with something very similar landing&quot;",
