        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (06:30): split(' ', 1)?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:04): i'm much better about it now, but there was a time where my timezone really had no correlation to my online hours",

        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:10): reason being we have three children (youngest 4) and their German is getting worse and worse (we moved over to Ireland in 2009)",
        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:10): so I'm always wondering what other people have experienced in that respect as I don't have any other references",
        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:12): (well, besides my sister who lives in Norway, she has two children but their language mix is even worse - German, Dutch, English and now Norwegian ;)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:13): dunno what to tell you",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:13): my written french is atrocious",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:14): and my vocab completely lacks any computer terminology",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:14): but i think if i went to live in a french speaking area i'd get back up to speed relatively quickly",
        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:14): fair enough, guess English is appropriate there to fill in the blanks",
        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:14): yeah",
        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:14): if there is a basis, the missing vocabs come over time",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:14): not that that's gonna happen unless the bay area falls into the ocean",

        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:16): he he, fair enough. actually I envy you a bit - not because of the GOOG position, that is well deserved, but the weather ...",
        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:16): it's so friggin damp and windy here",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:17): the weather and the people/culture are the main factors for me",
        "8fc019e59244da41feafed752bc36331 (07:17): so, when I'm a grown-up, in some 20y, I also want to work in the SF area ;)",
