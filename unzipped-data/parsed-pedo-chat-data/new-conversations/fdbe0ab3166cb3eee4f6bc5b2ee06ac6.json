        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (23:53): I mean that if you declare your own custom vocabulary in some formal way, that in no way aids anyone in understanding that vocabulary if they are not specifically aware of it",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (00:01): I wonder if their transform would actually handle xml-events and xforms (they declare the namespaces but don't use them)",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (00:02): guesses no, since scripting would have to work on the post-transform DOM)",

        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (00:22): I'll give it a read. I got some stuff working in FF and Opera, and got some other stuff working in IE. It all seemed completely different, but then I didn't have the faintest idea what I was doing.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:23): I have no idea what IE does. If it doesn't follow the spec, that document won't help",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (00:26): as I recall the expressions resolved similarly, but it was figuring out how to invoke them that was quirky",

        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (00:50): when I find issues concerning say a weird document.write script that seems to change styles in one browser but not in another I have no way",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (00:51): to figure out even which spec to begin looking in to know if it's a bug or my misunderstanding of how it's supposed to be -- the specs have gotten a bit spread out",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:03): so are all these e-mails still actually introducing new information, or is each e-mail repeating an earlier e-mail?",
