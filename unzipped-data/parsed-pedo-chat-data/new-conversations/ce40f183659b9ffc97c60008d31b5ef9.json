        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:20): hmm dont see jasonb on as much anymore",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:20): i wonder if he's still planning to use my webbapp as an example",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:20): &quot;(08:33:51) jasonb left the room&quot;",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:21): yah, that's what I said ;)",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:21): hehe.. well i just thought i'd let ya know.. since you entered after",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:24): i just moved a webapp from jrun on windows to tomcat 5.5 on linux.. and i'm getting question marks all over the place.. i guess an issue with character encoding? i'm doing some googling but dont really know how to attack this..",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:24): ah",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:25): are you doing any password hashing?",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:25): or any md5 digest stuff?",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:25): nope.. just text from a sql db",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:26): well, I know that the linux VMs seem to use a different default encoding and when doing hashing I've had to force certain encodings",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:26): hmmm",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:26): we're changing Strings into byte arrays",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:26): in your jsp code or in tomcat config?",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:26): if you do that with a UTF-8 string for example, for a 10 character string, you get 10 bytes",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:26): but for UTF-16, you get 20 bytes...",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:26): and if you try to create password hash from this, it obviously won't match",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:27): we've been going this in the code",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:27): gotcha..",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:27): i *think* we've tried ways to force tomcat, but they haven't worked",

        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:27): i'd like to find a way to do it in config.. since we're trying to keep the two code branches as similar as possible",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:28): there are ways to do it in the config... i forget off hand, olemme see fi I can find somehting",
        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:28): i know we've tried it, and I'd be curious to hear about your results",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:28): why we're keeping the windows branch beats me.. but i dont make the decisions unfortunately",
        "9fce39c97ccc933ee5e64a94416fb55b (22:28): i'll let you know for sure if i find a way",

        "89ecee15b8eff380f619b2d6ca05014b (22:33): ok yeah that's what it is",
