        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (18:56): quick question, would adding some foil on one side of an omni-directional antenna make it somewhat directional?",
        "3f8130964490a5cfb6a38cd4d53a41ee (18:57): yes",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (18:57): ok, and would anything other than foil work?",
        "3f8130964490a5cfb6a38cd4d53a41ee (18:58): for example, a reflector lambda/4 away from a dipole turns it into a 8dBi directional",
        "3f8130964490a5cfb6a38cd4d53a41ee (18:58): any flat metal should do",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (18:58): hmm",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (18:59): I'm actually mainly trying to pick up TV with my TV card (I have a licence!), but the antenna provided doesn't pick up anything :\\",
        "3f8130964490a5cfb6a38cd4d53a41ee (19:00): oh",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:00): I can scan everything from ~45MHz to IIRC 85MHz, but nothing gets picked up. :|",
        "3f8130964490a5cfb6a38cd4d53a41ee (19:00): i think you'll have a hard time with the huge wavelength there",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:01): *850MHz",
        "3f8130964490a5cfb6a38cd4d53a41ee (19:01): i have the same problem and not even amplifiers work",

        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:02): thing is, normal TV's work, but only with an amplifier. However, I currently lack one, and was hoping for an alternative way",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:03): I ponder if I could even work out the gain of this tiny thing :\\",
        "c7ed3b91bb2f076fb0ad9c2f49e1dba0 (19:07): NeoThermic: what tiny thing?",
        "c7ed3b91bb2f076fb0ad9c2f49e1dba0 (19:08): NeoThermic: got a card and antenna for DVB-T?",
        "c7ed3b91bb2f076fb0ad9c2f49e1dba0 (19:09): since they usually live in much closer to 850 than 45Mhz",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:10): AndyCap: tiny thing as in tiny antenna",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:10): it can't be more than 7 inches in height, including the base :\\",
        "c7ed3b91bb2f076fb0ad9c2f49e1dba0 (19:12): ok. seen small omnis sold with hybrid dvb-t/analog cards.",

        "c7ed3b91bb2f076fb0ad9c2f49e1dba0 (19:13): nah, not necessay, but what card is it?",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:13): it's a USB one",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:13): with an external antenna connection :P",
        "c7ed3b91bb2f076fb0ad9c2f49e1dba0 (19:13): still, I guess the best hope is finding a better antenna, :) and a frequency plan for the area.",
        "c7ed3b91bb2f076fb0ad9c2f49e1dba0 (19:14): ah, yes usb. that says everything, (not)",
        "8bd443a1a058b3b3984c7f62586b5bbe (19:14): any idea where I can find the latter?",
