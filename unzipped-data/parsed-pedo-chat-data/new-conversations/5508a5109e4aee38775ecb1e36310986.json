        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (11:02): It appears http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/issue-76-objection-poll/results?view=compact is behind an ACL that's not open for group members (maybe it is for W3C members, though)",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:22): it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:22): it claims that the &quot;results are open to anybody&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:23): but based on what you said, that seems to not be the case",
        "60659cfda992013e610f285c46692d28 (11:23): yep",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:24): the compact view is never open to non-members",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:25): though so far, it's claiming four people replied but that there are no replies",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:29): something funky there",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:35): at least he didn't quote the Dalai Lama",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:35): or the Obama Peace Prize &quot;war is good&quot; acceptance speech",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:38): and only awarded to people who bomb large numbers of civilians in Afghanistan with predator drones",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (11:38): At least until someone invades Sweden and renames the prize after themselves, I guess",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:39): you may not have noticed they have also subtly added some implied scare quotes to the name too",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:39): I invaded Sweden but I forgot to bring an army",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:40): I think that prize has always been one long surrealist/absurdist joke",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (11:40): (btw, I filed a sysreq about the poll issue)",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:43): Since it doesn't give people from the opposite view an oppertunity to debunk any novel points you make",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:44): I don't really like the model we have put in place",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:45): I also note that Sam's suggestion that only people who would otherwise file FOs should respond is rather obviously broken",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:45): I have no idea, I'm just not a fan of the difficulty imposed on keeping the spec as-is",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:46): And the relative ease with which you can create that difficulty",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (11:46): Since proposing a change is fairly simple",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (11:47): 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: Given the current model of multiple change proposals and non-poll-polls I would suggest that making the responses hidden and encouraging everyone with an opinion to respond would make the process more likely to favour good technical outcomes and less likely to favour people prepared to game the system",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (11:48): Keeping the spec as-is just requires you have better arguments than the people proposing the change, which should only be difficult if the proposed change is a good one",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:49): personally i think the system is fine, i'm just worried that the decision will be based on arguments that are then not applied consistently to the rest of the spec",
