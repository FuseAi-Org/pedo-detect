        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:05): hey, isnt QT supposed to be GPL?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:05): It's dual-licensed.",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:05): which means what?",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:06): (i know 2 licences, but thats about it)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:06): Which means if you pay Trolltech you can use it under a non-GPL license.",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:06): so, i can use this eval as long as i want under gpl?",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (06:06): probably not.. if I catch the drift of your question",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:07): No, the eval is a demo of the commercial versions.",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:07): i just got the vc2005 unsupported eval",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:07): Yeah, that one isn't GPL.",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:07): that and the supported eval are the only 2 on the site",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:07): Nope, there's the open-source one too, under a different link.",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (06:07): Bizzeh: what is it you want to do? Make an open source or proprietary application?",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:07): its not anywhere under &quot;downloads&quot;",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:08): so, its not where it should be really",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:08): blockd: open",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:08): <a href=\"http://qtnode.net/wiki/Download_Qt\">http://qtnode.net/wiki/Download_Qt</a>",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:09): so you have to mess around on google, or know where to look to find the free version, which has vc projects removed",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:09): seems qt are more interested in pushing for peoples money than for free software",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (06:09): the free version is easy to find.. but Trolltech's website *could* get to the direct download faster.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:09): You go to the Downloads section, then Qt, then the Open-Source link.",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (06:09): but then again, I think they're just trying to make sure people use the right licence",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:10): where the right licence is the one you have to pay for",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (06:10): hardly",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:10): If you're a closed-source developer, yes.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:10): If you're an open-source developer, no, but they don't want commercial developers getting the GPL one.",
        "bc1644a667fed2d4947fc9b454e78747 (06:11): so, trolltech are automaticaly assuming everyone is a closed source developer by hiding their opensource link away, and restricting the open sourced one's use",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (06:11): I sensed sarcasm dripping from Bizzeh's last response there...",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (06:11): next to last now... =p",
