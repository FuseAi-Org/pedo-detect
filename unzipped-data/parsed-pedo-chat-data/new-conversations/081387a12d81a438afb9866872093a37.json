        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:16): but given that I've just moved and have to buy a whole lot of expensive furniture and applicances, it's not a top priority",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:24): If they come out with a new HD Wii, then I would expect it to have HDMI",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:26): I mean, you can't buy a non-HD TV anymore",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:27): Apparently over half the people who played Gears of War 2 on the 360 don't have HDTV",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:27): are CRT TVs still availalbe anywhere at all?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:27): and I'd expect such people to be more technologically advanced than the average consumer",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:27): (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/epics-mark-rein-interview?page=3)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (14:28): I don't have an HDTV yet myself. I might be getting a second hand one soon though",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:35): Gears of War without HDTV would be quite unfortunate",
        "cd4b22ed5d04ebb783a3fd8ab0a39490 (14:37): process question for you w3c process afficianados: &lt;track&gt; element is in whatwg version of spec, but not latest w3c from 23 May http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/ (that I can find). why is that?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:39): accessibility community complained about the proposal being in the specification (specifically the WebSRT format)",

        "cd4b22ed5d04ebb783a3fd8ab0a39490 (14:51): wouldn't everything be much duller without two parallel-ish specs?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:52): we'd be back to XHTML2",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:59): They're not parallel specs, they're matryoshka specs - you can choose to read a page of the author subset of the W3C subset of the WHATWG's HTML5 subset of WA1",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:59): which is all a subset of what people call HTML5",

So i can check against the size of the initilaized data base object... Now how do I know how many bytes each char is roughly occupying in the websql store?",

When we do a call   db = openDatabase('documents', '1.0', 'Offline document storage', 5*1024*1024) and then say keep using the webstore.. there seems no way to actually know how much space is a already occupied so web app can increase it some how?",
        "9d5e71d4d1fd373540a8fca06dfa5ecb (15:26): as in is there a way to know that?",
