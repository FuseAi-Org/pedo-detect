        "a03bfa2a78d00389c65221c74759cbb4 (08:43): Hi c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:44): Hey a03bfa2a78d00389c65221c74759cbb4.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:46): Winding down for the evening. I have about three meetings tomorrow with my company about my involvement with the WG. Looks like they're very interested in supporting me.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:46): So a small victory in my world. :-)",
        "a03bfa2a78d00389c65221c74759cbb4 (08:47): nice",
        "a03bfa2a78d00389c65221c74759cbb4 (08:48): in what ways will they be supporting you?",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:48): I'm guessing giving me more forecasted time to work with the WG, potential travel, suggestion/input sessions, etc.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:49): Right now I have &quot;any free time&quot; to work on it, but now I'm looking to get ~4 hours a week of dedicated involvement.",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:55): nice",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:55): Ah hey 8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc. How's your day been?",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:55): And three meetings?",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:56): they better provide lunch",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:56): Oh they are. :-)",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:57): c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca, pretty good actually. Department interviewed another graphic design intern today.",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (08:57): I think that puts the total at 8 so far; no one stellar unfortunately",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:57): I have no clue what my availability will now look like though, apparently our divisions head of technology said, &quot;Come to him for your accessibility and standards needs.&quot; There goes all my slacker time. ;-)",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:57): Wow, 8 interviews?",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:59): We're interviewing web dev's right now for our team and we had a couple we wanted to take on but they were too &quot;new&quot; and we wouldn't have enough time to ramp them up until July.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:59): &quot;new&quot; meaning they had the skill, just not the experience. :-( I hate having to turn away talent.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (08:59): Luckily I wasn't involved in the interviews.",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:00): I don't usually sit in on them since I'm the development lead for our team, not directly related to graphics.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (09:00): Ah yeah, it's always good to get a sense of personality though, would you be working with them in any fashion?",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:01): Probably for branding purposes and on site at conferences. We're the Graphics &amp; Conferences team",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (09:01): Ahh yeah I remember you mentioning that.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (09:02): Are these college interns or recent grads?",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:02): Mix of both, I think the one today was a recent grad.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (09:03): It's always an issue of, &quot;Do you take the eager student willing to do anything, or the recent grad needing that critical stepping stone into the professional world?&quot;",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:04): The big killer so far is people being shy. Its a real interview killer if you don't talk and ask questions.",
        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (09:05): So true! If the interview doesn't flow like a conversation, I instantly feel distant from the person to a certain degree.",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:08): yeah",
        "5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67 (09:10): Mornin'",

        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (09:11): Yep, that quiet in here tonight. :-) How are you doing?",
        "5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67 (09:12): Pretty good, downloading mails so I can read them in the bus",

        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (09:13): I need to spend a good while reading up on all these technologies that are flying around the mailing list.",

        "c938c62ecadcab91676bdf5e857fb8ca (09:14): I'm *very* new to the engineering of HTML so research and self-education is my key goal right now.",
