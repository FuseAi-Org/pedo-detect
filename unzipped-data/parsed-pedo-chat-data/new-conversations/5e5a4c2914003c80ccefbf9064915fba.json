        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (16:55): Hey Guys... I'm trying to implement Two-Factor Authentication for my VPN device. I've been looking into RSA technology where users carry a keytag around that changes a pin number on the keytag every 60 seconds (used in conjunction with the users password). Has anyone used this type of technology and know if there are any alternatives that may be a little cheaper? I'm just trying to improve the VPN security we have..",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (16:56): well, you can take a look in OTP softwares, associated with freeradius for example",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (16:58): OTP softwares?",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (16:59): One Time Password",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:00): there are &quot;lot&quot; of way to create OTP, you can give a little paper to people with a lot of number, and ask them to type a given series which change every time",
        "a4ce7890e7d888e6c13c3d5df0367744 (17:01): heh ako prelozim do slovenciny &quot;provozu&quot;",
        "a4ce7890e7d888e6c13c3d5df0367744 (17:01): ups sorry",
        "a4ce7890e7d888e6c13c3d5df0367744 (17:02): wrong window",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:02): ahh",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:02): asyd, is there a more &quot;easy-to-use&quot; method you know of?",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:02): like i'd need a solution that managers could use who are not very computer literate",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:03): easy-to-use ? RSA token",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:03): it might frustrate them with a paper with a bunch of numbers:P",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:03): RSA is expensive though.. that's why i was looking for alternatives",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:03): im nto sure what is out there in the wild..",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:03): as usual, I think it's difficult to thing 'easy-to-use', 'easy-to-deploy' and 'cheap'",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:03): i dont mind hard to deploy, even if it requires some development work from myself",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:03): have you think about X509 (store on Smartcard) authentication ?",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:03): but cheap and easy-to-use are the core requirements",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:04): i did think about it, but it's not really OTP",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:04): I think it's better than OTP, but it's my opinion",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:04): how so asyd?",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:04): and some laptop (like dell) have an internal SC reader",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:05): like the way i see it",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:05): if that key is compromised, say it's read through some trojan on the PC",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:05): it's then able to be reused by a h4x0r.. in combination with other requirements",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:05): if the key is compromised, click on &quot;revoke&quot; buttoon.",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:05): though in the case of RSA, it's not",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:06): but the user may not know it's compromised",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:07): asyd, i was thinking about doing a home brew solution",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:07): anyway, as I said, I'll prefer the SC solution (but ok, it's my work ;p)",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:07): similar to what you said using free radius",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:07): but write some system that sms'ed the user a small passphrase",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:07): so the user had to enter that passphrase in that came via SMS",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:07): it's for internal usage (I mean, inside a company), external (http access..), both ?",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:08): i dont mind hte SC sollution asyd, my only gripe against it is the user may not know it's compromised if the pc they are using has a trojan for example",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:08): it's for employees to access from home",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:11): well, if most of case, even if there is a trojan on the computer, it can't fetch the private key",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:12): but be sure I understand your point of view",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:12): asyd, may I ask what vpn device you use?",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:13): We currently have a snapgear device.. (cyberguard), but i was thinking of changing to a cisco",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:13): just a base model of their 3000 series from memory",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:14): my work is to install and writing political documents of PKI, not using them ;p but I used to work with 3005, which have OCSP and SCEP support",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:15): (I guess all Cisco VPN devices have them. and anyway, a VPN device _must_ have OCSP support if you want use x509 authentication)",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:15): I see",
        "eea97a00c5e6bf3ad55d4ca171f3e390 (17:16): asyd, are you cissp certified by any chance?:P",
        "e55e49dbdc0b3b324ddec7711f265523 (17:16): nop",
