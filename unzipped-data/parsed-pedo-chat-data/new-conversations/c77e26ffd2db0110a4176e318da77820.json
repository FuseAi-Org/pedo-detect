        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (18:16): basse: so you'd basically like the text of the menu entry that was triggered?",

        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (18:21): sender() can be dynamic_cast to QAction*",
        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (18:21): but make sure you check the pointer before using :)",

        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (18:34): your QAction subclass could perhaps also have internally connected triggered() to some own slot, then emitted a new signal with the data you want, ie text()",
        "0895ebd08ba0530fe593e02233d03f8f (18:34): yea sender seems to point to my subclass too..",
