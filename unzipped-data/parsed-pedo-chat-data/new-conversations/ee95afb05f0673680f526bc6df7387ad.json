        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (20:18): set the retention policy in rman to get the correct files",
        "37d2de30a27c46d835b1351ae69ab8be (20:19): What I'm aiming for is that it would sense that the datafiles are no longer on disk",
        "37d2de30a27c46d835b1351ae69ab8be (20:19): so it should want to remove the entries from RMAN",
        "37d2de30a27c46d835b1351ae69ab8be (20:20): I know it did this with backupsets",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (20:20): you should let rman delete the files.. not os commands",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (21:15): you can hint it to load a table in to memory",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (21:17): oracle is quite good when it comes to the automatic stuff",
