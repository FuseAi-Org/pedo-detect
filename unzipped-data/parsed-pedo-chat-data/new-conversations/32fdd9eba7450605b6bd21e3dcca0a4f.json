        "3eac7f7bd26359c38567dd2959158bbf (09:03): the thing is, it &quot;appears&quot; to be somewhat working, but i honestly have no idea what i'm doing here..",
        "feab4dc99fda1f3538ce4795fe1ac92a (09:03): The usual question is why do you want to add Apache httpd? :)",

        "3eac7f7bd26359c38567dd2959158bbf (09:05): because i'm trying not to expose anything extra on the net than need be, and because i'm just going to be using this for one servlet, so to me, it was just sensical to have it available in the main website url path",
        "feab4dc99fda1f3538ce4795fe1ac92a (09:05): Ok, so you already have httpd doing other things.  Just checking. :)",
        "3eac7f7bd26359c38567dd2959158bbf (09:05): yes",
        "3eac7f7bd26359c38567dd2959158bbf (09:06): i have the workers.properties, it appears to be working since /apps displays tomcat info, and so on, i just can not for the life of me figure out why /apps is unavailable..",
        "feab4dc99fda1f3538ce4795fe1ac92a (09:06): so we're getting through to Tomcat... (the 404 comes from Tomcat)",

        "3eac7f7bd26359c38567dd2959158bbf (09:07): now /apps is in the apache docroot, is that a possible cause?",
        "feab4dc99fda1f3538ce4795fe1ac92a (09:07): Does it work w/o Apache, on :8080 ?",
        "3eac7f7bd26359c38567dd2959158bbf (09:07): yes, under debian, tomcat listens on port 8180",
        "feab4dc99fda1f3538ce4795fe1ac92a (09:08): ... and you can get to /apps and it does what it's supposed to?",
