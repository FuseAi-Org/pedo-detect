        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (13:51): quick question: I see how formnovalidate attrib works, but I don't see an example of how novalidate is used",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:54): &lt;form novalidate&gt; ?",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (13:55): sure, but if I put novalidate on the form, why bother putting an attribute like required on the input field?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:55): E.g. with forced previews you could put it on &lt;form&gt; though I suppose in most cases you might as well put it on the button",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (13:55): not sure what a forced preview is - sorry!",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (13:56): the example in the spec for formnovalidate makes absolute sense, but I can't see the use case for novalidate",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:56): ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd, e.g. you have to roundtrip with the server at least once before you can actually submit a comment",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:56): ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd, for that first roundtrip validation is not needed, but user feedback might still be useful",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (13:57): I still don't see how this works in &lt;form novalidate&gt;",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (13:57): sorry, I don't mean to sound like a pain/muppet",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (13:57): trying to understand the difference :)",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (13:58): one mo, let me mock up my understanding of formnovalidate, and perhaps you can tweak the source to show me how novalidate would work - if that's cool?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:00): sure",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:01): example: http://jsbin.com/inaxo3 - editable source: http://jsbin.com/inaxo3/edit",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:01): so I've got a formnovalidate on the &quot;save&quot; button",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:05): my form would have only one submit button",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:06): see the form here: http://annevankesteren.nl/2010/03/css-wg-brainstorming#comments",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:06): sure - but imagine the form is some big ebay style thing where there's lots of content being saved",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:07): it's a contrived example I know :)",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:07): it's more to show the formnovalidate attribute working",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:07): but I'm struggling to see how novalidate comes in to play",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:07): sure, i was just saying that for preview you might not care about validation yet",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:08): and therefore add novalidate to &lt;form&gt;",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:08): if you use it on the form element, then what's the point in having validation on the form at all?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:08): user feedback while entering controls",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:08): you still have the form controls apply and all etc. it just doesn't prevent submission",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:09): sites might want to use this too if they don't care if the user got the email address correct or not",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:09): but still want the control to integrate with the address book and create better input methods",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:09): okay, *that's* what I was looking for",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:09): perfect, cheers.",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:10): I can see it being used on the type=&quot;email&quot; input, and as you said, still benefits from web forms integration",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:10): cheers :)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:12): to be clear, &quot;novalidate&quot; cannot be specified on &lt;input&gt;, just on &lt;form&gt;",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:13): crap.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:13): wonders if validate and formvalidate would have been better",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:13): okay, so - say we didn't want to validate the email address field, and used type=&quot;email&quot; to still integrate as you suggested",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:14): no, it's either all or nothing",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:14): but I want to validate the required field of their name",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:14): crap.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:14): I just gave email as an example",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:14): okay.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:14): for &lt;input required&gt; it's the same",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:14): ideally you would people to fill in a name and give feedback to that effect, but if they don't it's no biggy",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:15): and you put (anonymous + md5(ip)) there or something :)",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (14:15): formnovalidate is really useful, I'm not sure novalidate is /that/ useful... :)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:15): it's mostly there for consistency",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:16): all attributes on &lt;form&gt; for which it makes sense are exposed on submit buttons",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:19): not sure it makes much sense for enctype come to think of it",
