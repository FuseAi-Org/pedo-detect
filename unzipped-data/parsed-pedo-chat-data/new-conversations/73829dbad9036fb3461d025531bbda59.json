        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:54): I can't reproduce it",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:55): that bug report reminds me that I should ask rubys if he has gotten requirements from tantek and zeldman",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:56): if the polyglot stuff isn't going anywhere, it should be taken out of the UI in order to stop confusing users",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:57): I see the bug in deployment",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:10): I guess I should get my Windows VM working again so I can help test on Windows",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:11): oh. awesome. so there's a way to create child processes from python that works on Windows",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:12): yeah, seems so",
