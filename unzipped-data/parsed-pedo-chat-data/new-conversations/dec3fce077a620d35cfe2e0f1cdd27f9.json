        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (16:13): Actually the sugar suggestion, whilst impractical, is not entirely non-serious for roughly the reason ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c mentioned; the fact that everything runs fullscreen means there is a lot less conceptual baggage around window mangement",
