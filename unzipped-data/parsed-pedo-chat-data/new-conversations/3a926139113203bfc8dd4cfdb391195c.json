        "564f60a2dd82ea24bfa3f2f615348f7c (00:43): interesting: http://gopollgo.com/vendor-prefixes-dot-how-do-you-deal-with-them",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:43): what's wrong with the URL of the search result?",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:44): effectively any view of a test is a search result...",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:44): if I want to link someone to a test report",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:44): I don't want to give them all the baggage of my searches...",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:44): thinks actually the search result part of it should be a query string, maybe",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:44): er",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:44): search parameters",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:45): ok, no current way, but how about I make the title of the test a link to the plain test?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:45): Hmmm",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:46): have another suggestion?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:46): Well, the other thing I'd like a direct link to would be the test itself",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:46): Not sure how to balance those two things",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:46): click on the source file",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:46): I do think the search parameters should be a query string, in general, though. They're name-value pairs.",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:46): (actually the plan is to have a tab interface with a view of the test in the same page)",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:47): ah",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:47): replacing the history view",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:48): having the search param as path components keeps the URLs search engine friendly",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:49): Wouldn't it make more sense for the search engine to treat http://test.csswg.org/shepherd/testcase/height-width-table-001/name/height-width-table-001/ and http://test.csswg.org/shepherd/testcase/height-width-table-001/ as the same thing?",

        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:49): (^^ to the hg docs)",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:49): I think the only thing that's missing is an example of what hg says when there's a conflict",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:49): working on that now",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:49): and what a conflicted doc looks like so you can find and fix it",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:50): cool",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:50): re the search params, it's all actually params under the hood, so switching between paths and query strings is a config option...",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:50): I'll play with it a bit as Shepherd matures",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:51): k, so I would suggest to let the search results listing be a path, and the test's search params (which are really only there to keep track of your next/previous links) to be query string... is that reasonable?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:51): because the report on a single testcase should always have the same URL, and be recognizeable to the search engine as the same page",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:51): I have to give it some thought...",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:51): but not unreasonable",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:52): I want to evolve the functionality a bit and figure out all the possible states before making a final call there",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:52): k",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:52): just something to keep in mind then",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:52): sure",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:53): as I said, that's all configurable"
