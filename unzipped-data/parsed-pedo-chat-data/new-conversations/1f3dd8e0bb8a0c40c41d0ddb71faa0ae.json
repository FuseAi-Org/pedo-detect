        "e4b4516c76138eba622347ffd704d1d5 (16:51): laucky: and asha is correct. if libraries are statically linked then it's very wasteful of memory and, whilst so called dependency hell is avoided, what happens when, say, a serious security bug is found in a relevant library? oh dear, you have to update every single application that statically references it (assuming the author has bothered to fix the issue).",
