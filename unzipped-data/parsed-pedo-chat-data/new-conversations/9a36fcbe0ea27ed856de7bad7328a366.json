        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:13): hi e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:14): flight leaves in four hours or so",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:14): how long is the flight?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:14): after which I'll be on nice 26 hour trip",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:14): on a*",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:15): 12 hours to Kuala Lumpur and another 10 to Brisbane with a stop at KL",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:17): christ, that meeting better be productive to be worth that much travelling :-P",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:18): i hope so",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:18): regardless of whether it's productive or not, it should be fun",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:20): aargh! Mike Schinkel responded to me off-list about my latest rant :-/",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:29): he also e-mailed another twenty e-mails or something which I deleted",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:29): oh, more!",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:29): +1 ++1+!+!!+1",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:29): +pi!",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:29): &lt;indent&gt;+!",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:29): yeah, I didn't read most of those either",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:32): &quot;Is there any reason note to standardize the switch syntax so it's not some IE specific thing, e.g.&quot;",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:32): some bad crack that guy is on :)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:33): yay!  Let's standardise browser sniffing and require authors to write specific switches for every browser",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:33): IE is going to have an opt-in",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:33): despite what you think, this will make life easier",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:34): i'm interested in their whole story",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:34): for instance, an answer to my e-mail would be great",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:34): the best we can hope for is to guide them to designing it in a safe way that screws other browsers the least and isn't condoned by the spec",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:35): he has a point about browser sniffing though",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:35): we had some cases where we support the same set of features as Firefox a given page uses, but we still break it",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:36): there's no way the web developers in the web standards community are going to accept a UA-specific switch",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:36): good",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:36): this is mostly because authors are not always informed enough to make the right descision",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:36): that would kill it then",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:36): for IE this problem is likely far worse",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:37): I'd like to see the response if he published the nonsense he's currently writing on public-html, on the IE blog",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:37): as all &quot;web standards pages&quot; are authored with IE specific switches",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:37): either simple UA sniffing or other stuff",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:37): dropping it all at once and arriving at the same featureset as Firefox seems like a very hard and impossible task to do",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:37): the response from most web devs would be uninformed",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:38): the thing Chris fails to realise is that CSS Hacks (the good ones, at least) were designed in such a way that when the browser because more standards compliant, they would no longer be applied",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:38): much like it is on digg.com /. etc.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:38): it's the same people who simlultaneously wanted xhtml2, backwards compatibility, text/html, no browser sniffing, and the browsers not to break their pages when they upgrades",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:38): they broke that when they fixed things poorly in IE7",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:38): anyway",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:38): i don't know where to go from here",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:39): yeah, IE7 was just guarenteed to break stuff",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:39): the CSS compat issue bite them and now they thing it applies to everything",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:39): virtually every web dev i have spoken too wants their DOM to be a tree like Firefox for instance",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:40): they even write their own fricking HTML tokenizers / parsers in javascript purely because IE generates a incest DOM",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:40): Chris needs to understand that it is unrealistic to aim for 0 incompatibilities with every single browser upgrade",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:43): it's realistic",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:43): they can do it",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:43): apparently market leaders can quite easily destroy stuff",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:43): this was never really clear to me before",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:44): they claim they can do it by not making any changes and requiring an opt-in.  But that isn't the way to make progress",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:46): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, you took back Window?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:46): oh, gosh, Mike says just: &quot;hehe!&quot; and &quot;ROTFLMFAO!!!  :-) &quot; - that's really pointless",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:50): my 20 above was joking but he's already set 16",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (09:50): today",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:57): I responded to Mike's off-list mail and cc'd www-archive",
