        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:11): well",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:15): I've noticed that in computer games, subtitles also rarely do anything fancy.  Most games don't even use italics or bold.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:15): Some actually even resort to *asterisks* for emphasis.",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:16): amusingly irssi made your asterisks into bold :-P",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:22): You could replace them with something like a whirring effect and it would make no real difference",
