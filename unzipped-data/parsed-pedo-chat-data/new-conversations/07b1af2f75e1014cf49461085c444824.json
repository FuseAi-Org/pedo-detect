        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (11:45): I was very amused at that discussion",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:47): folks at the W3C can be pretty sensitive about getting called on doing stuff that's not Webby in the sense of being part of the interoperable platform implemented in browsers",
        "e2633ed61085592add6e058692dfff2f (11:51): I'd be surprised if chromium didn't support range requests with video",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:54): I wonder if they'll drop ffmpeg and use the Xiph libs and libvpx directly when they drop H.264",
        "e2633ed61085592add6e058692dfff2f (11:55): I think ffmpeg's webm decoder is faster than libvpx",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:21): I wonder why the git and release activity around the WebM QuickTime Component has ceased",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:31): If Microsoft really does by Skype, then I wonder what will happen to the support for VP8 currently in Skype 5?",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:36): (the latest download for linux is a version of 2 labelled beta)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:37): (although cynical people might point out that 2-anything is a win over 5-anything)",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:37): the Mac Skype 5 sucks. 2.8 is still superior for usability.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:37): Well I haven't really used it on windows much",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:56): anyway, it's pretty clear that the world needs VOIP that's not tied to a particular app vendor",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:59): one of the big problems with getting cross-vendor VOIP is that if you leave e.g. the mobile part to traditional vendors in that space, they will want to use a proprietary codec and will let carriers impose ridiculous restrictions",
