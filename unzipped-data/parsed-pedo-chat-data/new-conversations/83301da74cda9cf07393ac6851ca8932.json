        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:38): The article says: &quot;For sophisticated cross-platform applications, there already exist several proprietary solutions (such as Mozilla's XUL, Adobe's Flash, or Microsoft's Silverlight),&quot; the group said.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:38): Who in the group said that?",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (01:38): that seems like a very confused bit of reporting",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:38): the spec says that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:39): so much for the spec not being a position paper. :-D",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:39): hahahahaha",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:40): i love the picture of chris wilson with a caption &quot;Microsoft's Wilson: modular HTML 5&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:40): that's hilarious",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (01:44): The picture reminds me of those british judges with wigs",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (01:44): Poor Chris",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:45): LOL",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (01:47): the IBM article that links to I haven't read before",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (01:47): has some good lines",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (01:47): &quot;The HTML V5 specification was written using good communication with browser vendors ... The team is sceptical about official W3C approval, though. The FAQ doesn't even try to give a serious answer about the expected date of approval.&quot;",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:48): IIRC, that IBM article wasn't very good",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (01:48): it's not, no",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:49): wow. I wrote that FAQ, and I certainly did try to give a very serious answer to that question",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:50): i thought the answer in the faq was pretty accurate",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:50): though, saying 15 years generally doesn't go down well with people and it works better if you emphasise that features can be used as soon as browsers implement them, rather than waiting for the finished spec",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): it took us 18 years to get where we are now",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:51): that's what I did in the podcast yesterday, and the host responded quite well to that answer",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): and html5 is specifying all of that and enough to take us forward",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:51): and they think 15 years to get two perfect implementations is too long? :-)",

        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:52): I've started having terrifying thoughts that I'm going to be working on Web browsers for the rest of my life",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:53): re the modularisation, they fail to realise that there may be a lot to write specs for, but there's too few editors to do it.",

Smith noted that while modularization of specification is a good idea in principle, the consortium needs a commitment from one or more member organizations to take over a part of the specification. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have that; nobody has stepped up,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.",
