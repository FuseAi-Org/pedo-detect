        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:39): will probably annoy everyone in here this weekend constantly asking for help with maths :P",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:40): likes people asking maths questions iff he can easily remember the answer, but otherwise it makes him realise how much he's forgotten",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:41): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: How much can you remember complex numbers?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:41): (Or rather, how to do anything with them?)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:42): Complex numbers are easy, they're just like normal numbers but there's two of them",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:42): :)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:42): Then hopefully it satisfies the iff",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:43): Alternatively: Complex numbers are easy, they're just geometry - you simply imagine each number being a line, and then the answers are obvious",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:43): doesn't like making imaginary things into real things to plot them on a graph though",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:44): it makes them seem real.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:44): complex numbers are easy, just s/i/sqrt(-1)/ and then it all makes sense",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:44): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Surely s/i/sqrt(-1)/g?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:45): i thought you didn't like me calling you g :-P",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:45): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: :P",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:45): is currently busy failing to remember how to do the maths for a Breakout game",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:45): wonders if sed has an h flag",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:46): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: do it on a text terminal, the collision detection algorithm becomes much easier",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:47): Actually I think the problem is not the maths, it's that I'm modelling the world as if it contains several independently-moving objects with infinite mass, which causes problems when the ball gets stuck between them",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:48): if they can both move and they can collide, that's gonna give you issues, yes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:49): you should do breakout using box2d's engine",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:50): complete overkill, but you could do some pretty funky things",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:50): like having the boxes knock each others over or something",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:50): Using a library would be cheating :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:51): using a library is sensible :-P",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:52): Being sensible is cheating",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:54): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, I'm very surprised that your working with complex numbers. I didn't that would be covered in high school. It wasn't for me.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:55): You didn't do complex numbers? :-o",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:58): That might have been covered in the 3 unit maths in years 11 and 12 that I didn't do",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:00): I saw a video once last year that explained how they work really clearly. I can't remember where though",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:00): shockingly, complex numbers were not covered for me until advanced maths (the math level beyond the normal A-level maths)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (01:07): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, seems XXX-Origin can be named Origin again",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:08): apparently",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:08): i think i'll wait for adam to write the i-d though",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (01:08): there will be an ID? ok",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (01:09): guess he can define authoring requirements and such then, neat-o",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:09): i hope so",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:09): gonna be pretty short, i expect",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (01:09): the header is already registered fwiw, but I guess doing it separately from both HTML5 and CORS is fine",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:09): it's CORS now?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (01:10): pretty much",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:10): cool",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:10): remind me to update xbl next year or so",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:10): :-)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (01:10): hehe",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (01:11): hopefully xbl has some implementor traction by then",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:11): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:11): i've heard louder rumblings than usual recently",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:11): so we'll see",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:12): i want people to implement type=date and type=color",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:12): in multiple browsers",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:12): that would get us a lot of traction i think",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (01:12): that'd be cool",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:12): (from the average author)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:12): i mean, i'd love to blog about html5 and say why it's a great idea and all, but it'll sound hollow until we have something concrete that authors can use widely",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:32): I found the videos that taught me about complex numbers http://www.dimensions-math.org/Dim_download2_E.htm (chapters 5 and 6)"
