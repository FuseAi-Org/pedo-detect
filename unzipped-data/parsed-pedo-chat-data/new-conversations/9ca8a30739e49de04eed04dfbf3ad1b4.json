        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (12:15): is there a good resource for &quot;onload events&quot;? i've looked at a few different libraries and the browser specific hacks aside there seems a number of ways to do it: onload. window.load, DOMContentLoaded, document.readyState. I'm assuming here I should have the DOM ready for an AJAX call.",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:48): good, I already find it slightly quirky that it's 12PM for midday (iirc), but this would be even more odd",
