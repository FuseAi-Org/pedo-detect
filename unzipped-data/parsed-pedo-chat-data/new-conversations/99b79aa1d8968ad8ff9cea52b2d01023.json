        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:43): (I guess html5lib hasn't either, since it passed that test)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:47): Looks a bit irritating how it says to drop the attribute value before you've actually got an attribute value at all...",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:48): tries to think of a nice way to handle that",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:49): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I have a boolean flag",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:50): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: and I defer the actual addition of an attribute til the value is complete or know not to exist",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:50): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: which was also the source of one class of test case failures you found",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:56): Adding another state variable makes other things more complex (like when verifying you never have to alter an attribute unless there actually is an attribute), so it'd be nice to avoid that if possible",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:01): (Well, it's fine to add a state variable into the C++/etc implementation, but preferably not into the conceptual model of the algorithm)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:12): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: So do you want html5lib commit access (hint, hint)?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:18): would someone like to volunteer to check an email about bikeshedding, belling the cat and economics 101 for suitability of sending to public-html? in particular, checking whether it is offensively patronizing?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:19): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: Oops, I forgot to respond to b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9's second comment - I expect it would be good to add these tests to html5lib (which is why I named the file test3.test already :-) )",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:20): at least once I've fixed the bugs, and added manually-written tests for the other bugs I have in my code",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:20): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I went ahead and gave you commit access whether you wanted it or not :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:20): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: I just saw that - thanks :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:36): wonders if it matters that his test cases don't have good descriptions",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:37): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I think I've fixed issue 50. Your testcases would be most welcome now so I can have some confidence that I did the right thing",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:37): And also because I promised them in the commit log :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:38): Just trying to fix the duplicate-attribute issue, which hopefully won't take long :-)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:38): Descriptions are good but probably not essential - the treebuilder tests are all description free, for example",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:38): But if you can add them, please do :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:39): I have no idea what most of my test cases are doing, so I don't know how to usefully describe them",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:40): Maybe I could convince the test-generating program to work out why it's choosing those particular ones, but that seems like more effort than would be worthwhile",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:41): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: I guess if you keep all auto-generated tests to their own file it's fine",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:41): notices he changed something and forgot to run the treewalkers tests",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:42): hmm. I guess I just send the message at the risk of offending some people",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:43): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Go for it. At least then we'll get email about how offended people are rather than whether or not Anne should include all his optional tags",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (14:44): which is probably the most boring thread ever",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (15:06): including one with duplicate attribute values, which html5lib fails",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:20): likes b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9's terse style",
