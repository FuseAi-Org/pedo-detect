        "c68cbce6c8b98bd6edf948d29aa9f7cd (06:01): eolog, the POST and BIOS has nothing to do with the operating system. POST (the process that does the memory count) will operate before your computer even detects your HD.",

        "c68cbce6c8b98bd6edf948d29aa9f7cd (06:30): I'm guessing that somebody messed up on it, and managed to ESD the hard drive. That would do it, right?",
