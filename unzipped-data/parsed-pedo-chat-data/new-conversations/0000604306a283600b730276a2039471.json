        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:12): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: there are some in the syntax module",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:12): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I've also used Anne's WF 2.0 tests, but using those in the test harness in now broken",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:13): as the spec stabilizes it makes sense to write more tests",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:19): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - btw, do you have a good estimate of many man hours you have put into work on the conformance checker?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:19): ... including hours of any others that contributed to it significantly (fantasai, maybe?)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:20): I'm just curious",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:25): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: no estimate. lots",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:27): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: the upper bound I can give is that there's no code written by me in there that predates October 2003.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:28): And the validation service started around November 2004, IIRC.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:28): Work towards applying it to HTML began in the summer of 2005.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:30): The November 2004 date is my guess about starting design and implementation. it wasn't public until 2005",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:32): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK. Was just thinking mainly about the HTML5 part, and thinking it might be good to eventually try to have an rough estimate of how many man hours are needed to implement a complete HTML5 conformance checker.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:33): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I cannot give an estimate that would be even remotely accurate. But I can say that the parser isn't the biggest part, so the reasoning &quot;we have a parser in language foo, let's make a conformance checker&quot; is missing the point",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:33): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:35): One thing I wonder is, given all the dependencies of your Java implementation, how much extra work it will be to try to implement a checker in another language.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:35): other languages",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:36): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: the biggest question is if you another programming language plus the same schemas or a totally independent impl",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:36): which I guess maybe are likely to lack equivalent libraries to depend on",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:39): afk",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:39): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - yeah, I know. about the schemas, seems like it would probably not be the most productive approach to try to implement something in another language that didn't also rely partly on schema validation",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (14:11): that's the ration between CSS and normal pixels?",

        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (14:13): yes",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (14:13): that could be useful",
        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (14:13): e.g. 1 CSS pixel to 3 device pixels would be 3.0",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (14:15): 1 to 4 makes 2 sounds more logical",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (14:15): anyway, if it's defined somewhere it might make sense to look into it",
        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (14:15): it's one-dimentional",
        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (14:15): well it's explained here http://webkit.org/blog/55/high-dpi-web-sites/",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (14:16): I learned that blog posts (with cat pictures on top) are not specs",

        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (14:17): the ratio is applied in both directions",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (14:17): yeah, so 1 to 9 makes 3",
        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (14:17): think of it as the sqrt of the difference in number of pixels",
        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (14:18): or better yet, think of it as the zoom factor",
        "9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76 (14:19): 200% zoom would produce a factor of 2.0  (i.e. 2.0 squared more pixels per image)",
