        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:06): But good news! They're going to remove appendix C from XHTML 1.0 to distance themselves from HTML as much as possible",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:07): It just happens that our XHTML means HTML as XML",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:07): It's not at all the same! :p",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:07): That means everyone agrees no xhtml over text/html",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (20:08): will IE 8 accept application/xhtml+xml, then?",

        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (20:14): W3C will continue its technical work on the language at the same time it considers rebranding the technology to clarify its independence",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:14): That could be misunderstood as even xhtml2 wg having given up on xhtml2 ;)",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:20): yeah, they should have rephrased it to say XHTML, but without referring to the whole series of specs",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (20:20): but, whatever, it says we need an XML serialisation, and that means XHTML anyway",
