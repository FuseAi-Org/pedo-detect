        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (05:44): for emacs the only think I found to work for Qt were the emacs files in kdesdk",

        "47df498cdcfcfd15933beeb0e306cb7c (05:47): Cool, I will have a look at what's in kdesdk. I have Qt highlighting/identation working so far.",

        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (05:52): you know how there's QApplication::font(), but doesn't the Mac have different fonts for different UI elements?",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (05:52): I've just been curious if Qt uses the different fonts or just uses one font for all.. by default anyway.",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (05:53): Just if you've noticed.. I'm not asking you to go check or anything :)",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (05:53): (I know each widget can have its own font, but I've just been wondering about what's set by default)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (05:55): Um... I dunno.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (05:58): It all looks like the same font to me.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (05:58): The same font is used all over iChat and it matches the font used in the menu bar.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (05:59): Safari... looks like the same font, bold, for tabs and bookmarks, otherwise the same.",

        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (06:10): not hard to do it oneself if it's compiled for a mac, but just curious",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:10): I'm guessing QApplication::font() defaults to kThemeSystemFont",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:10): Or maybe it's kThemeApplicationFont",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (06:10): I'd have to look",
