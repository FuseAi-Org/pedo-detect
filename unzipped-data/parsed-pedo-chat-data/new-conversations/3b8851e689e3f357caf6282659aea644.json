        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (19:42): solaris x86",
        "a4a16fa360254e973a304a48ebe8fecd (19:44): depends on what linux distro you are comparing it to",
        "d7b02719c780a791ff147479f6d18a24 (19:44): ChickenTalons: About 263",

        "13d302032f9ecb786adfb94061757afc (19:45): I would have said about this much: &lt;-------------&gt; (not to scale)",
        "d7b02719c780a791ff147479f6d18a24 (19:45): Linux is a kernel. Linux distros differ in ease of install/admin/use. Solaris is really easy if you've been using it for a decade or more, otherwise it's archaic and nasty",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (19:46): Justin?",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:46): solais is bit more admin friendly comparedto linux, in terms of tools available",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:47): swap linux and solaris around in that sentence",

        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:47): linux has more tools",
        "a4a16fa360254e973a304a48ebe8fecd (19:47): ChickenTalons: well, you won't have to waste a lot of time building the base system:)",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:47): solaris is more low level",
        "a4a16fa360254e973a304a48ebe8fecd (19:47): technically solaris has lots more tools... /usr/sbin/*adm .. just I'd prefer that most of them didn't exist",
        "a4a16fa360254e973a304a48ebe8fecd (19:48): there is something to be said for self documenting config files that can be backed up or checked into $RCS",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:48): no luxury such as lspci -vvv",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:49): the startup scripts are easier to admin on solaris imo",
        "a4a16fa360254e973a304a48ebe8fecd (19:49): yeah, svcadm is nice",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:50): ChickenTalons, just get vmware installed and try solaris 10 x86 on it",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:50): you'll get the idea (eventually)",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (19:50): I have a spare box",
        "a4a16fa360254e973a304a48ebe8fecd (19:50): they key to solaris seems to be to always install the full distribution from cds..",
        "a4a16fa360254e973a304a48ebe8fecd (19:51): it isn't designed like debian/gentoo/etc for you to install the base system then add only what you need",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (19:51): im having good results with rhel but the life cycle is a bit fecal",

        "c84247cefeb3a07c65c26753231e17f7 (19:51): no, the key is to do the first few installs with everything, so you have everything to learn and not get frustrated because you left something out",
        "c84247cefeb3a07c65c26753231e17f7 (19:51): and then, aafter you know what you need, strip out",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:52): put it this way, for home use get linux, for business get solaris",
        "7745adb1bd8df8704f3f993df58bc843 (19:52): X Linux has some tools, Y Linux has some more, and Z Linux may have a little more; but SMC alone outweighs (literally) them all.",
        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:52): linux has far more hardware compatibility on the x86 end",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (19:52): SMC?",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (19:53): this is pretty generic HW, im pretty sure its all supported",
        "dff09d08b03833697502f8e3cf8fb03f (19:53): if not, oh well",
        "c84247cefeb3a07c65c26753231e17f7 (19:53): super magnificient crap, othewise known as solaris management console",

        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:54): personally i'd install slackware over solaris on any of my x86 equipment (and run solaris under vmware)",
        "7745adb1bd8df8704f3f993df58bc843 (19:54): Solaris x86 support is better than ever, at least I can say that for Solaris Express.",

        "54c5939a266d93845cc6fdfb0230c0b5 (19:56): i mean in majority of cases linux is more mature in x86 hardware support, however he has generic older hardware which should work alright",
        "30be2a14ef322f5376f60d0aa6590965 (20:03): If I've got a solaris 8 box up and running at a remote location, is it possible to jumpstart it from the local disk?",
