        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (05:20): would you expect math markup to appear around casual sums, like people adding up the cost-per-year of their TV service?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:21): but i wouldn't be surprised to see it in a web page talking about 3d graphics",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (05:21): ok, so we only expect math markup from people who are fairly serious about maths?",
