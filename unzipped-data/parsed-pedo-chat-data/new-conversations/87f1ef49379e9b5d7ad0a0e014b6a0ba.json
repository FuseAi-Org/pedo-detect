        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:13): It's hard to do that Jari, because vertices can belong to several vertex groups. A vertex doesn't have to just have a single vertex group &quot;owner&quot;, it can have several.",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:15): hello folks.. anyone know of a script or way in pose mode to mirror a pose on the left and right side without having to actually grab entities on both sides (a bit like you do in edit mode)?",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:16): Copy the pose to the buffer, and paste as mirrored?",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:16): Does that not do what you want it to do, ptryk? (they are a collection of 3 buttons, with up and down arrows on the toolbar in pose mode)",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:17): nah.. that just flips the pose.. mirror it, like in edit mode when you move a bone on the left, the right moves as well?",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:18): basically to create symetrical movement without all the work.. if not, maybe i can try to script something :S",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:23): Oh",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:23): I see what you mean",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:23): Hrm, perhaps you could add a constraint or something to link one of the bones to the other so that they follow each other",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:24): Do you need them to follow in all things? Scale and rotation in all axis?",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:24): hanclinto .. yeah, i thought about that, but i was hoping to use it only in a limited fashion to save some time when posing ..",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:24): Ah, gotcha'",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:24): i am looknig now for something that can handle rotations, but i could image scale and position being of interest but MUCH more complicated to script",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:27): hanclinto .. thanks for your thoughts and time :)",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:28): No problem. :)",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:28): I wonder if pasting as mirrored wouldn't work in some situations",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:28): Because if you just copy one half of the model's pose to the buffer and then paste it mirrored, it makes the other half do it as well",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:29): (and you don't have to select any of the entities on the other side)",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:30): hanclinto .. YEAH!.. you know, you don't have to save the position of the complete armature.. i just paste the flip and save only those that need to be &quot;mirrored&quot; .. voila! :)",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:31): hanclinto .. thanks again!  i figured there should be a way to do it :)",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:32): No worries. :)",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (19:32): works great!",

        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:32): Did you figure it out on your own before I told you?",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:32): (it almost sounds like you did)",
        "57af79070d7fe3bf09b44c3a8e0d313d (19:32): If so, great job. :)",
