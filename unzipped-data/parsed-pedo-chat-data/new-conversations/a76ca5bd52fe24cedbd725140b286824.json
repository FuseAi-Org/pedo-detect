        "1489594aa48468c31658b4865ae4cb8c (04:05): make sense?",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:05): so, make the div 200px wide, with a backround image",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:05): or, the h1 or whatever",
        "1489594aa48468c31658b4865ae4cb8c (04:06): ah yes, that make sense",
        "1489594aa48468c31658b4865ae4cb8c (04:07): ty",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:07): you'll probably also want to set the height, as I imagine you don't want that being dictated by the text either ;)",
        "1489594aa48468c31658b4865ae4cb8c (04:13): good plan",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:19): does css have a way to make &quot;hanging indents&quot;, where all lines after the first of a paragraph are indented by some set amount?",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:22): dfletcher: text-indent: negative will make the first one go backwards",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:22): hmm that might work",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:23): it will, use padding to 'indent' everything (left padding) then text-indent to unindent the first",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:23): or, you can use :first-line to set the padding to zero on the first line, if you prefer that method",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:25): hmm yeah I think I just need to make it a table - I just realized I don't really know the exact pixel size of the radio button which I'm trying to hang-under",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:25): unfortunately it's Drupal CMS generating the code so it's not exactly simple changing it ;)",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:26): or hmm 2 divs with float: left on the one with the radio button might work",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:26): er, wait.  radio button? you shouldn't need to do much then, should already do it for you",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:26): huh? in what browser does a radio button automatically become a hanging indent?",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:27): they're not bullets :P",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:27): just make the text be inside a block element",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:27): alright lemme try that",
        "945a14b8698d8c548e14fd410bf2638f (04:27): :)",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:28): then the block is pushed (well, the label, set to inline-block or whatever) to the left by the radio button, but it's a block, so it won'tflow around the button",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:29): gah the text and the radio button are both inside a &lt;label&gt; tag - so label { display: block; } ?",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:29): no.  why is your radio button inside the label?",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:29): why oh why doesn't css have :text() like xpath :P",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:29): because Drupal puts it there",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:29): psh.  drupal is stupid",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:29): bs",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:29): it's awesome",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:29): this poll module does suck tho",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:32): aha maybe it does that because then the text becomes &quot;hot&quot;",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:33): you use for to do that",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:33): for?",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:33): for in the label",
        "55a87b76818b813b121153b105bf8a10 (04:33): ah",
        "558848280fb221d89a4e69527ff5d4a9 (04:33): &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;'hot' text, as you put it&lt;/label&gt;"
