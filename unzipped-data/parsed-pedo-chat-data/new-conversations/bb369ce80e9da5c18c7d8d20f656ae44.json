        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:22): so X becomes the bound element",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:24): if you have a problem with the answer you should speak to 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e of 2003 and 2005 :-P",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:24): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e of 2011 is mentally ready to merge XBL into HTML and change everything in the process (though not ready in terms of available time, but that'll come)",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (03:26): The Hitler Conservation principle is well-known, so there's no reason to try to fix that.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (03:26): (Any attempt to stop Hitler inevitably ends with WW2 still occurring in roughly the same or worse manner.)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:38): Maybe the reason time travel has never been invented is that whenever someone invents it, they mess up history, so the second person to invent time travel travels back to prevent the first person inventing it",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:38): at which point they become the first person and the cycle repeats",

        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (03:52): I liked the futurama where timetravel was only possible forward - and then they found that time repeats anyway",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (04:53): IMO: getContext should propagate exceptions from context creation, clear the &quot;primary context&quot; on exception if it was just set, and prohibit null as a return value entirely",
