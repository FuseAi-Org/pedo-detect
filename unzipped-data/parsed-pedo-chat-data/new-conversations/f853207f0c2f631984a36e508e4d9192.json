        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:18): It means you're busy working while everyone else is available, and as soon as you stop working and have some free time everybody else stops working and becomes unavailable",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:19): It'd be more efficient if everybody was assigned a random number between 0 and 24 at birth, which is the offset applied to all their working hours",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:20): because then a large fraction of people would be available at all times, and you'd never have to worry that all the shops are about to shut",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (18:24): Well, it's sort of annoying if your business hours don't overlap with people you're supposed to interact with",
