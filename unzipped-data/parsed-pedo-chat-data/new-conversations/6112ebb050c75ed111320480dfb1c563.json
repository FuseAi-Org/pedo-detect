        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (17:50): Hi, i'm just learning C# a few things, is using multiple namespaces a good way to split code up in the same section or is this bad practice, and the use of ternary operators as opposed to normal if statements?",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (17:51): ternary operators aren\u00a5t used very often, not intuitive when reading",
        "c6f32004a50cc131a8c75e4bd4be45bc (17:52): they are life-savers sometimes",
        "c6f32004a50cc131a8c75e4bd4be45bc (17:53): but try to avoid them",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (17:53): they seem pretty useful, but i see :) and the namespaces, the example im reading has a namespace, call another name space like namespacename.namespaceclass.method();",
        "e35295a96392ca74daea05eb905c6444 (17:53): why &quot;life-savers&quot;?",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (17:58): why unreadable?",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (17:58): I'd say they are quite readable indeed, as long as you're not doing crazy stuff like nesting",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (17:59): Sarkie: The use of namespaces is entirely a matter of taste really. If you think your class warrants its own namespace, do it. Otherwise there's little point",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (17:59): just for code readability?",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:00): how does it make the code more readable? please give an example",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:00): does anyone know the answet to my previous question?",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:01): what question was that?",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:01): well spliting up the sections of code say i have a massive program, and i want main stuff in main namespace, and i have say a database helper that does all the database stuff, do i put that in another namespace or a a new class?",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:01): Macke: that about datagrid and getting selected row from dataset",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:02): pks: Can you identify the selected row in any way?",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:02): no",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:02): then it's going to be tough =)",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:02): sorry, but I don't know much about the datagrid",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:02): I used to use Xceed's grid",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:02): i can get its x,y coordiantes in the datagrid",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:02): how do you get that?",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:03): i get the value of current cell property",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:03): so it works as logn as i dont sort or filter the data inside dataset/table",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:03): Sarkie: I usually split things in major parts",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:03): e.g.?",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:03): if I notice I have a lot of GUI classes, I might make GUI namespace",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:03): Macke: Im new to OOP",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:04): ah right, all related",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:04): indeed",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:04): so say i had a lot of database access, make Database namespace, and put all database classes in there?",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:04): I wouldn't make a namespace for just a few classes though",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:04): sure, if it's warranted",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:04): &gt;5 ?",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:05): are you sure those &gt;5 can't be consolidated?",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:05): fuck knows I dont have any, this is all theory",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:05): ha",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:06): =)",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:06): damn, rikkus isnt here",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:06): he would know the answer ;/",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:07): also does the VS compiler know variable types, ive noticied doing console.writeline ( {0} is just first variable, rather than say %d? so what ever ive declared it, it will be output, so i have to do decimal places differently",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:08): you can format strings",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:08): like so: Console.WriteLine({0:0.0});",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:08): ah",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:08): that would output a number with one decimal place",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:08): I think",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:08): I never remember them format strings",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:08): lets try :)",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:08): but i see not so different",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:09): Honestly, I think %.1f was easier",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:09): ;o)",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:09): ditto",
        "c660158b3701e3e230c0ce136cacbe42 (18:09): but sometimes it didnt round correctly :)",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:10): either i am very stupid, or framework people didnt think that someone might be willing to actualy get the data from selected row/cell",
        "e505731e6b55a3669fff5d6bea3ba11b (18:11): pks: The DataGrid is a beast",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:13): yea, probably i will have to run function bar with the row number i want to get xored with the hash value of &quot;foo&quot;",
        "9351c00f73660c0a9076d185506e355f (18:13): or something intuitive like that",
