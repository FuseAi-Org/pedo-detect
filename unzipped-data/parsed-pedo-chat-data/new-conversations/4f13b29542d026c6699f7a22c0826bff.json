        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (17:46): can anyone recommend some good canvas demos that will work in Firefox 2.0.0.10?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:47): define &quot;good&quot;",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (17:47): not tests",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (17:48): something that will impress your friends",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:48): http://simon.html5.org/presentations/html5-geekmeet.en points to 3 demos",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:50): f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678: You really don't want 2.0.0.10",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:51): because drawImage doesn't work in it",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (17:51): umm, http://tapper-ware.net/canvas3d/ doesn't work because of that",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:52): Use http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2.0.0.11-candidates/rc1/ if you want anything non-trivial to work",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:52): or use Opera :-)",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (17:53): are the any dev tools like PHP or something that make it easy for devs to generate canvas code? GWT?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:53): http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/ is still my favourite canvas demo but I'm totally biased",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:53): f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678: Why would you want to generate code, rather than just writing it?",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (17:54): ok, my use case wouldn't be games (like several of the demos I've seen)",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (17:55): i want to perhaps visualize data with canvas. so i'm left wondering perhaps howto get access.log and &lt;canvas&gt; to talk",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:55): Like http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/ ?",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (17:56): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: ah, that's more like it",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:57): or you could use svg :)",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:00): SVG almost detracts from canvas. Because you can use SVG for example instead of &lt;canvas&gt; in plotkit can't you? And probably in a lot of other use cases too",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (18:01): likely",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:01): There are lots of cases where they can overlap",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:01): and some of those are nicer in canvas, and some are nicer in SVG",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:02): and other cases can only realistically be done in one or the other",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:03): ok an example for specific case",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:04): can SVG do animation? canvas can defn. do animation",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:04): canvas is somewhat supported in IE6 right? that SVG isn't?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:05): SVG can do declarative animation, and you can do scripted animation too",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:06): hmm, so there is no distinction between the two with animation",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:06): There's a nasty hack to get some support for some parts of &lt;canvas&gt; in IE, which it seems people are using successfully in practice",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:07): I don't think anyone does the same to make SVG work in IE",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:07): so +1 for canvas. kinda.d",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:08): i need IE6 on this macosx machine i have for testing",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:08): f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678: There is a distinction - e.g. SVG lets you animate a single object moving, whereas canvas requires you to repaint the entire screen whenever you change something",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:09): and SVG has annoying bugs in most implementations when you try doing something fancy, whereas canvas is more predictable since it has simple bugs instead of fancy bugs",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:10): so there is some talk about canvas3D",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:10): silly question: can SVG do 3D? :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:11): Canvas-3d is pretty much totally different to canvas-2d",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:11): (http://blog.vlad1.com/2007/11/26/canvas-3d-gl-power-web-style/ etc)",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:11): and so would SVG-3D I guess (if it exists?)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:12): SVG is just focussed on 2D, and doesn't make it easy to emulate 3D",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:12): There's stuff like X3D which is kind of analogous to SVG except 3D",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:12): http://apike.ca/prog_svg_threed.html",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:15): thinks if i could do a couple of ven diagrams showing 1) support in browsers 2) use cases it could accomplish",
        "f4dfad803df83144a5be86d9bca87678 (18:15): perhaps a little pointless as the future (support + features) is probably the most important elements in my mind.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:15): That cube appears to not work in either Opera or Firefox 2 :-(",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (18:17): From what I've seen, canvas-2d allows slightly more impressive 3D emulation, though obviously it's all useless compared to canvas-3d"
