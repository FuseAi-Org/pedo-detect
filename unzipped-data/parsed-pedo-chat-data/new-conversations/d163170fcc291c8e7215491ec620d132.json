        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:19): 57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450: have you ever used SVG fonts?",

        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:21): I will freely admit that",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:21): yeah, there you go",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:21): I'm not a font designer",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:21): nor do I try to do anything funky with web pages",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:22): if those are the only use cases you've heard of, then you clearly haven't done the research or even thought very hard about it",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:22): then maybe you aren't the target audience, hm?",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:22): I  intend to mean the use cases that are not served by other font technologies",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:23): I don't suppose you could be more enlightening?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:23): yes, there are other use cases that SVG fonts serve that aren't solved by other font formats",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:23): such as...",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:23): multicolored text is useful, even if you want to be dismissive of it",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:24): having fills that are not simple colors (or gradients) is another",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:25): having overlapping lines, as has been done with hand-drawn and printed glyphs for thousands of years, and is used extensively in print advertising and art, but can't be done with other font formats, is another",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:26): being able to customize a font, or draw one from scratch, is another",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:26): embedding specific glyphs inside a single document (no external references) is another",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:26): it is possible to handle multicolored text with existing technology (i.e., heavy use of &lt;span&gt;)",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:27): embedding without external references seems like a poor design goal to me",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:27): that duplicates the text, and isn't very accessible or maintainable",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:27): color isn't accessible",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:27): animated glyphs can also be useful",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:28): 57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450: wtf does that mean?",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:28): if I'm blind, I can't see color",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:28): first off, accessibility doesn't mean &quot;blind&quot;\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 there are lots of different kinds of disabilities",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:29): I'm trying to figure out how manually coloring each glyph would be less accessible than a font which automatically colored some of the glyphs",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:29): second, duplicating text to get multicolored glyphs for sighted users means that screen readers will double up the text",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:29): &lt;span&gt; isn't duplicating text",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:29): which is why your response is confusing to me",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:30): you'll have to be more explicit in how &lt;span&gt;s make a single glyph multicolored",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:30): withut duping it",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:31): I am personally not aware of cases that cause multicoloring of single glyphs",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:31): and if you're just talking about changing the colors of individual glyphs in a word, you've just killed search, find, screenreading and all other uses of having a word",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:32): 57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450: then I suggest you look at print advertising, where it's used all the time",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:32): no, a&lt;span&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;c is matched when I search for 'abc'",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:32): [I just tested it]",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:33): in a screenreader?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:33): in a search engine?",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:33): no, the Ctrl-F",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:33): not good enough",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:33): I am also dismissive that print advertising should be written in HTML",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:34): make some real, comprehensive test cases, and test them, and show some proof, then I'll credit your research",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:34): for that use case, I would support SVG fonts, but I do not think that warrants them as a necessity for support in a web browser",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:34): yeah, I'd say you're pretty dismissive, I agree",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:34): you are you to say what HTML should be used for?",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:34): the primary case people are talking about is web browsers",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:35): and whether or not SVG fonts should be a feature implemented by web browsers",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:35): you think designers don't want to build on the tradition of print media in browsers?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:36): (and not just print, but TVs, giant screens, etc?)",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:37): why should it be necessary that you send the exact same content for a TV and a large poster advertisement that you do to my desktop computer?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:37): why do you think HTML, SVG, and CSS are just on desktop computers? this isn't the 90s",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:38): I do not think that",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:38): let me rephrase it slightly",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:38): should my web browser support the same APIs as, say, a Tivo?",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (06:39): I am arguing that the domain for which svg fonts is suitable is not the same domain for which a web browser is intended to be used",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:40): and I would need to see much more evidence that that is true, because all the evidence I've seen is that the convergence of TV and the Web is already here",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:40): TV is now a service, as much as a device",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:41): one of my TV providers, Netflix, uses a Web browser on my PS3",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:41): it's written in HTML",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:42): (at least on some devices, if not on PS3, I'll have to check that)",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:43): HTML, CSS, JS, SVG, APIs, etc are now a primary programming platform, not just a &quot;Web browser&quot; ghetto",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:44): I'm surprised I have to make that point",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (06:45): they know their business, and what they (and their clients) want to do",
