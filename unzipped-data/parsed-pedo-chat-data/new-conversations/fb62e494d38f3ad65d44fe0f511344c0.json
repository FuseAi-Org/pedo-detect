        "aac6faa59982955179bb909138afd162 (11:44): it still does that, but innodb has its own thread stuff as well, i think",

        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (11:48): Postgres has had a few issues over time, but I think that 8.1 and up are pretty solid.  And it's much more SQL than MySQL is. =P",
        "aac6faa59982955179bb909138afd162 (11:49): left: 5.0 is getting there",
        "d91102e790545be0a09c1f715ac4926b (11:49): twincest: Yes, it's heading in the right direction I suppose, but it still feels like a toy. =P",
        "75dd2071a30b7c94d9361f05f06d524c (11:49): does mysql even follow ACID semantics yet?",
        "aac6faa59982955179bb909138afd162 (11:50): yes, if you use InnoDB",
        "75dd2071a30b7c94d9361f05f06d524c (11:50): not long ago it deviated in some pretty egregious ways...",

        "aac6faa59982955179bb909138afd162 (11:51): you can run mysqldump in a transaction ;-)",
        "aac6faa59982955179bb909138afd162 (11:51): takes a while though",

        "aac6faa59982955179bb909138afd162 (11:51): that's okay for us though, we need backups in a different form anyway, so we don't bother with database dumps",
