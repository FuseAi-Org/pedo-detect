        "361699642668dafef3cdea989c6c5007 (22:58): MySQL uses a REPLACE INTO syntax that checks a specified primary key value against those already existing in the table and either performs an INSERT query if a record with the specified primary key doesn't already exist or an UPDATE query if it does. Does Oracle have an equivalent functionality?",

        "37d2de30a27c46d835b1351ae69ab8be (23:00): MERGE might not be exactly what you want",
        "37d2de30a27c46d835b1351ae69ab8be (23:01): it isn't one magic statement like I assume you are after",
        "361699642668dafef3cdea989c6c5007 (23:02): Eh, so long as it does the same thing. I'd like something similar, but if this does the job and it's all there is, that's what I want.",
        "37d2de30a27c46d835b1351ae69ab8be (23:05): Elazar: yeah I'm afraid MERGE is the way to do it in Oracle",
        "58ea25453030aa1cda4c7b52097ab1f5 (23:11): Hello all. Is it possible to create oracle exports (not data pump), compress them and maintain them just by using PLSQL",
        "58ea25453030aa1cda4c7b52097ab1f5 (23:11): At them moment i have using unix scripts to do all this, but was thinking of doing this in other alternate ways",
        "58ea25453030aa1cda4c7b52097ab1f5 (23:11): any suggestions or recommendations ?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (23:15): run exp from dbms_scheduler?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (23:15): horrible way, but possible",
        "58ea25453030aa1cda4c7b52097ab1f5 (23:19): hmm...",
        "58ea25453030aa1cda4c7b52097ab1f5 (23:20): why is it such a 'horrible way' ?",

        "58ea25453030aa1cda4c7b52097ab1f5 (23:23): current problem is that, i have like 6 or 7 sites to manage (and more to come). All goes in anyway, so might as well use Oracle methods to do all the admin stuff as well",
        "58ea25453030aa1cda4c7b52097ab1f5 (23:24): no need to setup shell scripts or batch files. No need for cygwin either",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (23:25): you can do plaintext file dumps from sqlplus, but thats not very usefull in a restore scenario",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (23:25): and doesn't handle clobs/blobs very well",

The odd thing is that I'm doing the same thing for another field, but using TO_NUMBER instead of TO_DATE, and that works fine.",
