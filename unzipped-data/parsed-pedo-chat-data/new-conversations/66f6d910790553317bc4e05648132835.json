        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:11): does anybody have time to tell me where is the selector that makes www.softimage.com page to be centered vertically in the middle of the display, please? I simply can not find that code..",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:16): the only way crossbrowser i know is to have a single cell table... &lt;body&gt;&lt;table id=&quot;outer&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=&quot;outertd&quot;&gt; put content here &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;   in css -&gt;  &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; #outer { position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; } #outertd { text-aling: center;  vertical-aligh: center; } &lt;/style&gt;",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:16): iirc it's like that...",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:16): that's what i used here : www.richardperreault.ca",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:16): StaZ[work], was that for me?",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:17): yes",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:17): oh softimage is only centered horizontally... what i gave you is to center both horizontally and vertically",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:18): in softimage i see they use body { text-align:center; }",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:20): StaZ[work], yes.. I was stupid",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:20): StaZ[work], I meant horizontal centering but I am tired",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:20): I wrote vertical instead of horizontal",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:20): it's all right, i've made stupider mistakes than that",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:21): so, StaZ[work], do you think that body {text-align:center} makes the fact that the page is horiznotally centered?",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:21): I put text-align:left, but the page did not get left centered.. hmm..",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:21): yes, as long as what you put in the body has a width that is not 100%",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:22): left centered?",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:22): O_o",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:26): now in the second example, i set a width to the div, so the div it selft is aligned to the right (according to the body) and the text is at the left of the div... so it means it's aligned to the left but starting at 50%",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:26): oh and... don't forget to put a doctype :P",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:27): ah yeah.. :-) many things you write here are new to me, but it is fine, because I learn a lot.. :-) I've been with CSS and HTML for about one week.. :-)",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:28): well keep it up, go on step by step",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:29): a little trick : get yourself Firefox with the Webdev toolbar plugin",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:29): that will let you quickly see source, css, validation, and lets you even edit the css in real-time",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:31): StaZ[work], yeah, I like learning from another code.. is something like that available for IE? I jsut dont want to put into my windows too many webbrowsers.. :-)",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:31): I will take a look, ineed, thank you for support.. :-)",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:31): BunkaiSK yes search google for &quot;web accessibility toolbar&quot; that makes almost the same as FF's but i like FF's one better",
        "132e476d5f149efcd8a028b22510d8c3 (23:32): IE's one have many things managed through popups",
        "581433f68655a67b62a8c48f9f07ff39 (23:34): <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/\">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/</a> &lt;- 3,400,000,000+ users can't be wrong&quot;)",

        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (23:37): It sucks though",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (23:37): Compared to the Firefox one",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (23:37): Nanobot: well, of course it does",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (23:37): Does it even have Edit CSS yet?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (23:37): Nanobot: I thought it didn't",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (23:37): But it does allow you to add to the dom",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (23:38): It didn't last I looke at it",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (23:38): which means you can add style attributes",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (23:38): Bah",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (23:38): so yes",

        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (23:38): in a really irritating way",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (23:38): That often doesn't help",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (23:38): webben, i will take both",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (23:38): Nanobot: If it wasn't painful, then it just wouldn't be IE would it?",
