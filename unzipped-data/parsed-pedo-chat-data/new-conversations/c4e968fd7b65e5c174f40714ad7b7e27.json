        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:07): i keep getting this: release\\myclass.o(.text+0x0):myclass.cpp: multiple definition of `Myclass::Myclass(QWidget*)'",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:07): what does that mean?",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:08): i only have one definition of the ctor",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:09): oh also if i have myclass.h and i #include it in myclass.cpp and then do a #include myclass.h in main.cpp is that bad practice?",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:10): or should i forward declare class Myclass; in main.cpp?",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:10): forward declare if you can, otherwise #include",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:11): there are some constants in myclass.h that i need in main.cpp",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:11): i guess if i need them i can just #define them in main.cpp huh?",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:11): *shrug*",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:12): #define isn't needed so much in C++",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:12): but if they don't really go with myclass.h, maybe have a different header file for the constants",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:14): thanks for the input, what about my first question?",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:14): not a clue",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:14): i keep getting this: release\\myclass.o(.text+0x0):myclass.cpp: multiple definition of `Myclass::Myclass(QWidget*)' -&gt; what is taht?",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:14): not without seeing the code",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:14): wait, let me recompile this first, just to see if the removing of the header file and forward declaring did anything",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:14): you said it's only defined once, so that's why I don't know without seeing the code",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:15): on a lark, maybe try using header guards around your .h if you haven't already",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:15): remember my comp takes a while to compile :\\",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:15): i have those set already",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:16): time to upgrade",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:16): you'll go mad if you have to compile something bigge r:-)",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:16): like to a 486 :-)",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:16): DX",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:17): its a 686, but i run other apps on here too",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:18): are they essential?",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:19): well like opera / firefox / ie for browsing when im waiting for compile yeah",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:19): its a 500 mhz though so its a low end",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:20): hm, it still seems slow though. a PII 380MHz 256 MB should still compile a simple program in no time",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:20): and gvim to edit + cmd to compile",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:20): 128 mb ram though",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:21): and running win xp pro on it makes it lag i guess",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:21): yeah, you probably want *at least* 256",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:23): ah good i think the header deal fixed it, but there is some other issue i now have to investigate :-S",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:24): im more of a java guy, so what does forward declaring classes actually?",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:24): **actually do",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:25): in a nutshell it just says &quot;this is a type&quot;",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:25): but you don't get the details until you include it",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:25): oh i see, thats neat",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:25): (c++)++ =)",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:25): it's a little invovled when just a forward declaration is enough, but off the top of my head: if you just need a pointer, reference, pararm, or return value",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:26): *param",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:26): it's not exact.. e.g., if you have a default argument that takes a value",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (09:26): plus templates need to be defined",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (09:27): as soon as you need methods or non-pointers the forward declaration won't work anymore",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (09:27): p_masho: pyqt is good",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:28): i dont follow, ive been forward declaring al lmy classes and within myclass.cpp im able to access everything's methods that i forward declared in myclass.h",
        "bb39f6fa774ce138e009a36951876998 (09:29): chakie: downloaded Crunchy frog to have a look at source :-)",
        "8a01dfce84063ec6d6a7638d5ceddc1a (09:29): also, is QT_REQUIRE_VERSION of any use? or is it just bloat?",
        "bb39f6fa774ce138e009a36951876998 (09:29): chakie: oops that gtk !",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (09:29): p_masho: no idea about that one",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (09:29): i know yqt well and have used it for a few years. it has very little problems"
