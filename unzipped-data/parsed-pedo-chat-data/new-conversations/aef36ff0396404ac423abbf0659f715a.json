        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:22): They're really really simple once you've got everything else done.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:22): Really?  It took me like 5 minutes to do them once I got circle and oval working.",

        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:25): you really want them implemented as close to the graphics hardware as possible, for performance",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:33): What would be the effect, though, of -moz-repeating-linear-gradient(red, blue)?",

The following combinations of values will trigger this: closest-side  if the starting-point is on a box edge, closest-corner if the starting-point is on a box corner, ellipse and closest-corner  if the starting-point is on a box-edge,&quot;",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (02:03): in those situations, the shape is simply a circle/ellipse with radius 0, isn't it?",

        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (02:10): I think it probably would be useful, e.g. it means you could animate the movement of an ellipse into the box by animating the start position",
