        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:01): JohnResig, 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, I added a very basic testsuite for selectors api. http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/webapi/selectors-api-testsuite/",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:02): it doesn't test much yet, I'm still in the process of working out the best way to write the framework.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:02): but take a look, see if what I have is a good start and let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:04): the plan is to run most tests within an iframe, which loads various HTML and XHTML files, and runs queries on them",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:04): and each test is a function within an array, written in tests.js",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:06): Would you have a single iframe, and run each test in it in turn?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:07): Oh, actually, I think I'm just misunderstanding the whole thing, so ignore me",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:07): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, yes, that's most likely",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:07): Are you always testing DOM-created documents, rather than downloaded-over-HTTP documents?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:08): no, the plan is to allow each test to either create a document or load a file into the iframe",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:09): Ah, right",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:09): not sure exactly how to do that, since such operations would need to be asynchronous",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:09): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I will ask weinig or somebody to tae a look",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:09): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, thanks",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:09): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: we have our own regression tests for querySelector but I doubt they are very powerful",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:09): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Run test 1, set onload to a function that checks the results and then runs test 2? Not sure what the problem is :-)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:10): we specifically didn't want to try to make tests for every possible kind of selector including edge cases, though come to think of it that would be more convenient than the tests with red and green boxes usually used for this kind of thing",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:10): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, yeah, something like that could work",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:11): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: we have a good test framework for tests that purely involve scripting APIs and not layout",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:11): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, ok. That might be good if I could build on that, instead of creating my own",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:12): Mozilla has a framework for that too",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:12): (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mochitest )",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:12): basically you just write a series of assertions in a JS file like this:",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:12): shouldBe(&quot;Math.abs(1)&quot;, &quot;1&quot;);",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:12): shouldBe(&quot;Math.abs(-1)&quot;, &quot;1&quot;);",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:12): Opera sort of does too, but it's not really something that's usable by anyone easily",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:12): and we have some JS files that implement the functions",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:13): ours is real easy to use",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:13): and gives pretty results",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:14): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: I'll mail you an example (unless you have a WebKit checkout handy in which case I could point you to it)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:14): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, email it",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:14): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: Is it easy to run individual tests by themselves? (Mozilla's Mochitests run a whole web server and a special browser mode, which is annoyingly complex)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:15): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: we group tests in files, all it takes to &quot;run&quot; such a suite is to open the html file in any browser",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:15): for fully automated execution we have a headless tool that loads all the html files in sequence",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:15): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: Okay, sounds good :-)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:21): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: sent",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:21): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: the three files starting with js- are the framework",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:22): elements-not-in-document.js is the substance of the test case",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:22): I might also have a script lying around to generate the wrapper HTML files for the script files (they just include the test script plus the CSS file and two helpers)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:23): but it's pretty trivial",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:24): makes good looking output though where it is easy to spot the failures and why they fail",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:25): in addition to the basic shouldBe tests there's also shouldBeTrue, shouldBeFalse, shouldBeNaN, shouldBeNull, shouldBeUndefined and shouldThrow",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:35): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, thanks",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:41): BBC News today reporting 4 in 5 15 y/os drink. That sounds far too lower amount.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:45): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, that sounds about right. I was one of the 1 in 5 that didn't drink at that age.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:45): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Here it is certainly higher than 4 in 5. Even 9 in 10 seems low to me.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:46): (I am that 1, no matter how many that is in :P)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:46): Does it mean 4 in 5 drink, or 4 in 5 say they drink when asked on a survey?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:47): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: The claim is the former due to the latter.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:47): If they just admitted it was the latter there would me less questioning by me :P",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:49): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, do you believe that ~1 out of 5 lied by saying they didn't, when they actually do?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:49): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Yes.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:49): what if some said they did, but actually don't",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:50): I doubt that would happen, though.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:50): I know nobody who claims that",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:50): maybe the only thing the survey can reliably tell us is that 15 year old kids can't be trusted",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:50): I know plenty of people who claim they don't drink, though",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:51): (But having seen them drink I can tell you it isn't true)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:51): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554, what's your reason for not drinking?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:52): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Well, I get allergic reactions drinking the slightest amount",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:52): or were you just one of the liars? :-)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:52): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: The group of people you know is quite possibly not representative of the entire country, so you can't use your anecdotes to argue against people who used Science and got written about on a website and must be true",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:52): allergic to just beer, or all alcohol?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:52): (where slightest amount means even a sip, not half a bottle as some of my friends would take it to be true)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:52): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: Beer, wine, whiskey. Never tried anything else.",
