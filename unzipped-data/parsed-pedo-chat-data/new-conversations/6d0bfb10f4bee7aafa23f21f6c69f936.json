        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:18): I imagine that wine is more application oriented rather than device oriented.",

        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:28): This is pretty much the same but has a more stable feel to it :)",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:28): Apparently it gets released every couple of years.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:28): well i cant really complaint too much about stability",

        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:29): What the differences are I am not sure except that suse is kde by default and this is gnome by default - and I was pleasantly surprised by gnome this time - it did not feel quite so old-fashioned to me as before.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:29): well thats good, if you like that :)",

        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:30): but thats a good thing...choice is always a good thing",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:31): I liked kde on SUSE and I surprised myself by liking gnome this time, I was all set to install all kde stuff instead but I liked what I saw ok and I was afraid that the extra files would just slow things down for me ;)",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:32): So, meantime anyway, I thought I would just stick with gnome.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:32): the newer gnome installs are very performant.  They are very adequate for most everyone.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:33): I tried the very newest recently on ubuntu...and it was very peppy",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:33): I tried kubuntu 6. something but I have not tried the ubuntu of the same version.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:34): kubuntu is basically just the ubuntu base with a KDE gui",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:34): ok",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:34): ubuntu, on the other hand, uses gnome as its default",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:35): but you can install the other from either version",
        "886d20cff3a367239edf2ee6de8593c7 (02:35): why did they do that and not just have a choice at the beggining of install ?",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:35): Whenever I have encountered gnome in the past, I have tended to steer clear of it - not because it lets me down but because I used to think of it as dull :)",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:36): well you can dress gnome up about as much as KDE, though its not as easy",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:36): I do not know why novell makes suse kde and sled gnome.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:36): of course, in just about any distro you can use apps from one in the other",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:37): I have the feeling that gnome has been tried and tested more?",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:37): eh I dunno either",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:37): well it could be that theere is less for their support team to worry about w/gnome??  I dunno.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:37): Actually with SUSE Linux you get the choice of which gui you want during install",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:38): but it would be nice if SUSE would get to a single CD install, and do they rest by net",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:39): I think that still has issues with many",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:39): Yes - but newbies like me are a wee bit scared to try to install non-default choices unless we really need them :)",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:39): However, it is nice to have the choice",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:40): Sled is aimed at office / home office environments as far as I can understand things.",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:41): well I think SLED could be targeted that way, yes.",
        "2f291c90eacf20eb33a90a23363d3480 (02:42): hi is it possible to move the home directory to another partition?",

        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:46): is it true that in linux .odd represents beta whereas .even represents release candidate?",
        "d922a22018d0a9684d9bc01814572a82 (02:47): In other words, should we expect 10.2 to be much more stable than 10.1?",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:47): hagus:  that used to be the case...not sure it is any more",
        "c322cf561b23d7bdb9b192a922e5679a (02:47): nono I think that only used to apply to the kernel",
        "5b61d2cc0223d1497173cb5ab988ef5b (02:47): that used to be the case with the kernel.",
