        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:52): rasterisation?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:53): i don't mean rendering, since it might not actually be shown, just turned into a path for further manipulation",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:54): Rasterization would be converting to pixels",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:54): Vectorization?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:55): But fonts are already vectors.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:55): Well, except when they're bitmapped fonts.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:56): assume for the sake of this conversation that we can ignore bitmap fonts",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (01:02): Hm, I know the word, but it's not coming to mind right now.",

        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (01:03): outlining",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (01:03): I think that's the term used in tools like Illustrator that take a text object and converts it to paths",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:04): outlining might work, though that tends to imply &quot;not filled in&quot;, which it could be",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (01:05): &quot;Font rasterization is the process of converting text from a vector description (as found in scalable fonts such as TrueType fonts) to a raster or bitmap description.&quot;",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (01:05): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9: Right, but that's not what 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e wants.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (01:06): He means doing the shaping, spacing, etc. necessary to get the final glyph vectors for the text, so you can then manipulate the vectors.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:06): (also, any ideas what Element should be used to determine the available fonts when you do some sort of font whateverthewordis on a Path object?)",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (01:06): the process of taking an input string, font selection, and coming up with a list of glyphs and their positions is probably just &quot;layout&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:06): (should Path objects just be created with a Canvas owner for this purpose?)",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (01:06): you shouldn't assume that that's the path implementations go through",
        "104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 (01:07): for example, they might rasterize each glyph of the font for the correct size and then blit the rasters",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:07): a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3: 104bc19e5513cba4eba2d18c7a704a01 we're talking about Path objects, where there's no rendering",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (01:08): that's just pathological",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:10): hm, crap, i also need an Element to handle 'em' units, 'larger', 'smaller', 'ex' units, and 'rem', 'vh', and 'vw' units, and the other v unit, in the context of Paths",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:10): i think i definitely have to make Path objects come from a specific canvas",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:11): but that means using canvas.getContext('2d').createPath() rather than new Path(), which sucks",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (01:11): new Path({context: foo})",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (01:11): too bad rendering fonts as paths will lose grid alignment, so will look bad at font sizes used for normal text :|",

        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (01:12): If they dont' give one, measure off the root element.",

        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (01:13): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: Yeah, it's a simple answer, and as long as you provide a way to grab a Path with a &lt;canvas&gt; reference, it's easy to fix when it's important.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:14): yeah that might be the way to go",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (01:14): (Btw, an Element isn't necessary to handle the v* units, is it?  Those are common to every element in the page.)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:15): yeah for those you need a Document, not an Element",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:16): i can imply a Document more easily than an Element",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:16): i guess not really, since we don't give a coordinate for measureText() anyway",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:17): so it can't be taking hinting into account",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (01:18): since it'll probably make it jiggle around weirdly"
