        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:14): Does non-native support count?",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:15): If so, who decides which non-native implementation should be counted?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:21): will fix once i have the multipage thing done",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:21): still can't work out why that's broken",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:23): (An &quot;edit&quot; link would be more obvious)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:24): It's not obvious what the &quot;tests&quot; or &quot;demos&quot; fields are meant to contain, at least when looking at an empty one",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:26): &quot;Section status: Widely implemented&quot; seems an odd option, since some features are widely implemented at the same time as the spec for them is a first draft (particularly when it's specifying old unstandardised features)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:29): there actually is an edit link, it's display:none",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:29): but i can readd it i guess",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:30): though if you know that double-click adds, it's not a far jump to double-click to edit",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:31): turns stylesheets off, and sees the edit link now",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:34): they look at whereever you double click, and find the first element above it to have an id",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:34): which will typically be an &lt;hx&gt;",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:40): it's not hard to explain",
