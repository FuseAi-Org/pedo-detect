        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (01:11): detach-, because they have extensive man pages,  --help is a  gnu thing.",

        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (01:14): flars are  flash archives. a very fast way to install a system including complete  applications you have used in the past,  bfu == blindingly fast upgrade  has another name but i'm lazy, its where you build the source your self and install on top of a working system.  verry fast",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (01:17): and i don't recomend upgrading every month or every chance you get, i usually upgrade every 10 builds or so, of if i hear a build fixes a problem or includes a feature i really want.",

        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (01:19): cool, then you should mostly be patching anyway... so all this is a non issue, since upgrades are quarterly at best.",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (01:19): the rest are just patches",
        "8ba6f29932eeb582d2d6e4e257d5f6fd (01:20): well if i just pop in a cd and hit upgrade it should work just fine right?",
        "8ba6f29932eeb582d2d6e4e257d5f6fd (01:20): does solaris have a tool like apt-get or yum equiv",
