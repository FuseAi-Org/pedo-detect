Oh, promise. My parents are gone.  \nSpeaker 1    00:37:30    You know, you look familiar to me.  \nSpeaker 17    00:37:33    Oops.  \nSpeaker 1    00:37:34    That's right. Oops. He's done it again. Michael Ryan.  \nSpeaker 17    00:37:38    Oops, sorry.  \nSpeaker 1    00:37:39    Do you remember Ryan?  \nSpeaker 17    00:37:40    Can can I just go,  \nSpeaker 1    00:37:42    What are you doing here, Michael?  \nSpeaker 17    00:37:44    I'm sorry.  \nSpeaker 1    00:37:45    You were just in court on Friday, right? Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. And what happened in court on Friday?  \nSpeaker 17    00:37:50    He said more time.",

But you gotta explain to me why or how you thought it was okay after having a court date stemming from our last visit. And then within 24 hours you show up at this house to meet another young girl. What are you thinking about now? You know,  \nSpeaker 17    00:38:18    I I know  \nSpeaker 1    00:38:19    It. You know what you said online, right? Yeah. How old is this girl?  \nSpeaker 17    00:38:24    Don't know.  \nSpeaker 1    00:38:25    13. She told you she was 13?  \nSpeaker 17    00:38:27    Yeah. And I told her go away. And she keeps eyeing me back.  \nSpeaker 1    00:38:30    You ask if she's got naked pictures of herself. You ask if she performs oral sex, what color her underwear is. Now Michael, you know this is not right to do this, right? I know we had this very same conversation in Riverside, California. Yeah. Do you remember that? Yeah. And right then you told me that you knew this was wrong. I know. And that you would never, ever do it again. And that turned out to be a lie, didn't it Michael? I promise this time if you rip it up, I'll never come back. Never come back. But if he appears to be a sad case, you should know that according to perverted justice Sibert has had sexual chats with at least three other decoys who said they were underage girls.",

What was the deadly weapon you used in the assault bat? And who did you go after with the bat? Some guy. Mm. Is there anything else you want to tell me? Michael? I know I did wrong. You did wrong. Can go Michael. You can go. But I'm gonna remind you that I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC and we're doing another story on adults who try to meet kids on the internet for sex. I know I did wrong. You can go, you can go right now. You can walk right out that door. You need cops out there. That's not up to me, Michael. It is. I'm not the police. So why don't you go ahead Michael. It's time to go. Cyber clearly doesn't want to leave having been through this before. He knows the police are waiting outside. I need a bathroom. Michael, you're gonna have to go outside. I come out, walk out. Walk out, get on your knees like the others. Cyber is charged with an attempted lewd act upon a child. He's pleaded not guilty. His lawyer says Sibert has severe mental issues. Is that a defense in any way? In this case?  \nSpeaker 12    00:40:36    In my mind, no. It's not a defense. He knows what he did was wrong. He knew enough that when you confronted him, his first words were, oops. You know, he knew enough to promise you that he wasn't going to do this again.  \nSpeaker 1    00:40:48    Did you live with your mom? Yep. He gonna kill me. He admitted to me during our interview that he had been previously convicted of assault. Yes. What does that say about the danger he could present to a young teen home alone?  \nSpeaker 12    00:41:03    My biggest fear is that he would show up. The young teen would decide not to go through with what they had been talking about in their internet chat. He would become frustrated with that and his violent nature would come out.",

Over the course of three days, 38 men were arrested in the investigation. Most would eventually plead not guilty. That's a large number of suspects, but the Long Beach police were ready. Did that seem like a big number to you? It's, it's our second highest number we've ever seen  \nSpeaker 12    00:41:44    Given the amount of population in this area. It's pretty much what we expected. We had a range that we set up, um, that we based the number of officers that the operation on and that came right into that range.  \nSpeaker 1    00:41:56    Coming up next week, you'll meet some more men who come up our driveway in Long Beach like this man, when he comes to our house, he seems to have second thoughts. So  \nSpeaker 28    00:42:05    What are you doing? Not too much. I was just  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:08    Talking online.  \nSpeaker 1    00:42:09    The question is, will he finally come inside? And for the first time since we've been doing our investigations, the police will set up in a nearby park where a suspect may be thinking he can lure a young teen into his car. Hey,  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:24    Everybody on this? Yeah, we got it. We got it. We  \nSpeaker 1    00:42:26    Got it. They'll be ready back at the house. Things will still get busy. Hey, how you doing? Don't you have a seat right over there on that uh, stool right there. Are those your friends outside with some trying to make a getaway? Take him,  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:38    Take him. He's running.  \nSpeaker 1    00:42:41    But the police will have other plans. Get on  \nSpeaker 28    00:42:44    Your knees now. Get on your knees.
