        "ce02da7f2783cdfa086c6d733f0b6e33 (01:09): Are questions about implementing HTML5 features in a CMS legit here?",

        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (01:10): sounds like it",

        "ce02da7f2783cdfa086c6d733f0b6e33 (01:11): Well, first question, if a page as a manifest file referenced it gets appcached itself.  However, when I then reload the page all of the CSS files it references (which are not in the manifest file) seem to be skipped.",
        "ce02da7f2783cdfa086c6d733f0b6e33 (01:11): According to Firebug's Net tab, it has an open attempt for all of them but they're all just spinning without responding.",
        "ce02da7f2783cdfa086c6d733f0b6e33 (01:12): Is that expected behavior?  Files referenced by an HTML page but not in the manifest are not re-downloaded (presumably unless they're in the NETWORK section)?",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (01:12): *shrug* i don't have much manifest know-how, but i just wanted to let you know it was the right room :D",

        "abd589783773baaadd50df900b41ee03 (01:32): hey folks, is there any mobile framework or widget library which you'd recommend as a starting point for someone wanting to build his own library, not worried about looking like the native widgets (apple, android, etc)?",
        "abd589783773baaadd50df900b41ee03 (01:34): probably projects like joapp.com, but stepping as little as possible in the js application real (that one I've got covered already)",
        "ce02da7f2783cdfa086c6d733f0b6e33 (01:34): So you just want a packaging system to turn an HTML5 app into a mobile app?",
        "abd589783773baaadd50df900b41ee03 (01:36): no, that I have, what I want is just UI elements, components, which I'll use to build my interface.",
        "abd589783773baaadd50df900b41ee03 (01:36): something focused mostly on the html + css, like stubornella's oocss",
