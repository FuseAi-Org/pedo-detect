        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:29): all i need to do is dataset.writexml(somewhere) and then later be able to read in a relative manner it back into a dataset in case the project folder is moved",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:29): which happens a lot",
        "9a7c07c053d564a9449e407a16e74ef5 (01:29): gaillard_: if you use a relative path in writexml then the path will be relative to the current working directory",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:30): . works fine",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:30): but that is a volatile place isn't it?",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:30): bin",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:30): needs to stay on rebuild",
        "9a7c07c053d564a9449e407a16e74ef5 (01:31): so set it to copy to the output folder when building",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:31): why are you running production source on a dev machine",

        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:32): KeeperOfTheSoul: ok",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:32): it depends entirely on what your app does",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:33): we're all ignorant",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:33): just a question of what we do about it",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:34): hm :P",
        "31aa88fcc9d4fcb2c71348bf7d399fc4 (01:35): KeeperOfTheSoul: ty very much!",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:35): but, it should be pretty obvious that you don't want to run whatever app it is out of the build directory",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:35): that's just asking for trouble",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:37): well i am still developing",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:37): so what do you mean?",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:38): while I am developing my project folder moves a lot depending on where i am",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:38): so i can't be using absolute paths, i am sure there is some standard way just can't find it",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:38): resources doesn't seem to work for this",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:38): you can either run it in a static place (IE \\\\foo\\bar) or relative",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:38): because if i make this xml file a resource when i do Properties.thexmlfile it gives me a darn string",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:38): static place?",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:39): its relative to what though, ALWAYS the bin/Debug folder",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:39): ?",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:39): no",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:39): its just an xml not something to run",
        "edfb3a72abbb7ecf6e8f40e7ba7a3bab (01:39): how do i use a datagrid?",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:39): b0lt: go find a tutorial",

        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:39): gaillard_: first of all you",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:40): you're not going to deploy to bin/debug on your target env",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:40): so, think of it as relative to your deployment",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:40): hmm ok",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:40): not entirely sure what you're writing out, but it's entirely kosher to shove it relative to the bin dir",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:40): IE bin\\blah",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:41): which yes, isn't persistent across builds",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:41): I guess KeeperOfTheSoul's suggestion to just copy is fine for now then for development",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:41): because it's not meant to be run out of the build dir",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:41): kog ya i see",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:41): it's a trivial problem to solve, and you're going to need to solve it",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:41): do it now",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:41): don't wait until 20 minutes before deadline",
        "9a7c07c053d564a9449e407a16e74ef5 (01:42): what's the difference between running from the output dir, or running from some other dir?",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:43): people's perception of structure",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:43): kog hehe this isn't a schoold thing :P",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:43): ok, if you have no deadlines in your open source work so be it",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:44): but by the time you slog through getting all your shit working, the last thing you're going to want to do is fuck with the release mechanism",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:44): and getting the release process done early ensures clean results",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:45): very good point",
        "9a7c07c053d564a9449e407a16e74ef5 (01:45): oh, I just always have it so the final output dir contains the complete thing ready for release",
        "62904c4a209ec26b3fbb74df751a83ed (01:46): that would be quite frustrating :(",
        "4a476a0eb7b5d064359936070b100f6a (01:52): hey guys",
        "4a476a0eb7b5d064359936070b100f6a (01:52): what is the most popular object database?",

        "44526ddcb53f6b7a8cadb1c196dd0d55 (01:53): yes",
        "44526ddcb53f6b7a8cadb1c196dd0d55 (01:53): this is the last fucking step",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (01:53): not my problem",
        "44526ddcb53f6b7a8cadb1c196dd0d55 (01:54): it takes you two seconds to answer",
