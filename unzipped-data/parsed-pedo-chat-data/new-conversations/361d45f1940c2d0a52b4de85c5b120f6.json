        "0c8dce20967cf80665e60051b8ab2d3c (20:04): I may not be able to attend this time",
        "0c8dce20967cf80665e60051b8ab2d3c (20:04): I wish we could have some agenda sent a day before telecons",
        "5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e (20:07): smaug: Oh darn. Yes, you're right. There should have been an agenda sent out.",
        "5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e (20:08): Do you have some time for a quick telecon (say, 30 min?) or do you have a definite conflict?",

        "5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e (20:10): An hour earlier than now doesn't work for you?",
        "5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e (20:10): (That's my best time slot)",
        "0c8dce20967cf80665e60051b8ab2d3c (20:10): not really today",
        "0c8dce20967cf80665e60051b8ab2d3c (20:10): and tomorrow I have another meeting",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:13): I don't see why not... we don't need to talk about everything, just get general agreement",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:13): and this gives me a chance to finish up my actions :)",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:15): because they aren't split out very well",
        "5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e (20:15): 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6: yeah, understood",

        "5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e (20:17): smaug: yes, but it might be spread across a few threads",
        "5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e (20:17): smaug: but all of it should be in the last couple months",

        "5059ecaa4fb3ab1183f267bf1613010e (20:22): OK, thanks folks. The only issue I don't think I will have addressed by tomorrow's telecon is the WebIDL appendix. It's almost done, but the checkin will likely happen after the telecon. Don't think there will be much issue with it, but I'd appreciate a review (I'll send mail)."
