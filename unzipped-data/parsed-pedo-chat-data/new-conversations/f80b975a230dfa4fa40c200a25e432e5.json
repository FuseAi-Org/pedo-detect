        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:40): My understanding (without trying it) is that it uses the platform media player to do the actual playing",

It's just that I don't want to seem like someone who hasn't done research (when answers might be SO simple even though they aren't for me) since I have done a lot of research",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:43): anyway, Opera Mobile 11 now has the questionable honor shared with Konqueror to be a browser that can't be subjected to a WebM .play() attempt",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:45): so I'd like to know if I should blacklist Opera Mobile 11 on Android, too",
