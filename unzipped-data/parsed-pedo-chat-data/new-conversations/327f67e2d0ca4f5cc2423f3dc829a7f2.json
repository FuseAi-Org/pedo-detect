        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:25): the reason i ask is this, would i be able to play around with and learn oracle on a linuxcomp at home, and be able to work on a windows 2k3server comp with oracle at work",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:29): bucky1: the answer is yes",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:30): i have win and linux boxes @ home. i was able to access the oracle db from both boxes.",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:32): well, im not talking about just accessing it...im talking about doing administrative tasks on the server",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:32): physically on the server",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:33): including admin tasks \u201e\u00c9\u00d1",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:34): 25% is very different",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:34): like setting kernel parameters",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:35): and working with window specific tools.. lika oradim",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:36): but sqlplus is still sqlplus..",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:36): no kidding. they are related to OS platforms. it would be different, but with oracle - it would be the same on both OS.",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:36): right?",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:37): ok",

        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:39): for just learning oracle administration, not actually using the db for anything of importance, just test dbs for php or .net apps i write, what system specs do you think i can get away with",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:39): bucky1: one thing regarding .net ... oracle for &quot;not windows&quot; doesn't have the CRL of course",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:40): crl?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:40): common runtime library (is that what they call it?) ... the c# and vb.net runtime in oracle",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:40): so you can't have stored procedures and functions in c# or vb",

        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:41): i mainly need to learn oracle to eventually get a dba, programming with it was something i was gonna do for fun..so its not that important",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:42): but is 1ghz 512mb ram on win2k3 server that is also running dns and active directory somehting that i could get away with",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:43): yes it is teoreticly possible... but you will be banging your head against the wall while oracle plays with swap :)",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:43): oh",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:43): damn",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:45): i installed 10g on a VIA c3 with 512megs and a 4200rpm 2.5&quot; drive once... spent years in therapy after that :)",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:45): i havent installed oracle yet, but does it create its own swap partition",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:46): i have 512Mb and it runs VERY good on linux server. i am impressed with it.",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:46): screw it, i think im gonna run it on linux",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:47): i have tried it on win server with 512Mb and it runs SLOW. that's why i switched over to linux. \u201e\u00c9\u00d1",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:47): ehh but i dont really have a spare box",

        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:47): does oracle use the pagefile, or does it create its own partition for swap",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:47): why?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:48): you can probably find a decent p3 box for 50bucks..",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:48): it will use linux swap partition; make sure it's 1gb swap",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:49): i mean... a 1ghz p3 is fine..  i' rather run 10g on a p3 with 1gb than a low end p4 with 512",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:49): im gonna talk to my boss, there are spare machines there that i might be able to convince him to give me one cheap",
        "16c7690c946b4701dc783ac70f549cfb (01:49): i second hali's suggestion; it will runs very good.",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:49): bucky1: ask them to give it to you... take it from the training budget",
        "168d8a2e903feee360ac441542b6f8e7 (01:49): ill also throw in a dedicated hd for swap or something",
