        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:06): yeah, lemme look on manual to conect speaker",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:06): it should be pretty obvious which one it is",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:06): 4 pins most of the time, should be labelled speaker also",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:08): typically close to the other system control pins, power switch, reset, etc",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:16): oook, no luck ;/ no beep",

        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:17): should give 1 beep for successfull POST",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:18): but all the fans turn on?",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:18): btw, another thing that happens is that after 20-30 seconds the system resets itself",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:18): yeah, all fans working ok",

        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:20): not sure, you could try taking devices out",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:20): have you used any of these components before?",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:20): i dont have anything else to take out except 1 s-ata 2 hdd",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:21): nope, all are brand new taken today",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:21): you can disconnect the HDDs also",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:21): could be an issue if i dont have keyb/mouse connected to it? tried with them too but same result",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:22): a keyboard is requires to boot",

        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:22): yeah but i should still have something on screen... it will not boot anyway cause hdd is unformated :)",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:23): although that does not explain the lack of video, a missing keyboard would just half the system tell you to put one on",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:23): exactl",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:23): y",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:23): I have had a hdd half the system on boot before, bad hdd the system would not boot, but it didnt half until it started to auto detect the devices",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:24): is your power supply big enough?",

        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:24): did you plugin the extra power into the video card?",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:25): nope, doesnt need an extra power and doesnt have support for it",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:25): if you have another video card somewhere, might want to put it in just to test",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:25): hmm 7900 does not require extra power?",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:25): k",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:25): It's 7600",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:26): 7600 or whatever",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:26): And not even GT... GS weaker one :)",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:26): i have an agp card but mb doesnt have agp slot ;/",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:27): ya, I dont know hard to work with it when you cant even get a picture going :/",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:28): imagine how frustrated i am after i was so happy to get a new computer after ~7 years :)",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:28): I would stick in a different video card see if it works (if you have one sitting around)",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:29): just agp ;/",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:29): heh I just got a new case yesterday, didnt boot on the first try",

        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:30): boo hooo ;/",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:30): rofl",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:31): odd that you are not even getting a beep",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:32): Could it be just because of those sw/led wires? in case manual says with label towards the front of the case (which is vertical)... but in mb manual i have a scheme which shows horizontal",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:33): when I said my case would not boot, it was because I had not hooked those up correctly, or at least one was loose",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:33): but",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:33): those should typically cause an instant shutdown",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:34): like, fan will spin for a fraction of a second then turn off",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:34): Mine all spin...",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:35): the cpu fan spins also right, its plugged in?",
        "e007bf0fb207121808488e619a124d65 (02:35): yeah",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:37): flash the bios?",
        "9ae65d634d1f8e7131d620c271cc2704 (02:37): although I doubt that will help"
