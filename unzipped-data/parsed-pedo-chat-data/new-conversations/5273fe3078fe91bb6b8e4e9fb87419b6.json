        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:37): but that would make the video's mute indicator and the system mute indicator not be the only indicators of relevance, instead adding at least one more to the mix",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:37): it seems end users would want to mute a video, but not necessarily want to unmute it",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:38): i almost never want videos muted personally, if i want audio off i want all audio off and turn it off at the system level",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:38): I think .muted should just turn into an author setting",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:39): i'd love a &quot;this tab is a source of sound&quot; indicator, but i don't think i care about turning the sound off at that level (though a shortcut to override all the &lt;video&gt; elements on the page in one go mighht be ok)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:39): mute control on youtube can say it should give sound, but I often have it turned off system wide anyway",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:43): i think mutating the dom would be really weird for the reason given by the CSS example I gave in http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-September/028755.html",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:43): (that problem isn't such a big deal for &lt;details&gt;)",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (11:44): why is it weird? if the author wants special styling for muted videos, it makes sense to have video[muted] match when the video is muted",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:44): isn't it the same problem for &lt;details&gt;?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:45): author assumes it is open/closed but it's the other way around based on earlier interaction (or maybe a preference/extension that expands all those controls by default)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:51): i would expect a difference because an author might have a bunch of muted videos that are always muted, and he uses that as a hook for styling them differently from the main video that isn't muted",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:51): e.g. imagine if the small poster frames on a youtube page were all live &lt;video&gt;s",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:52): that's different than &lt;details&gt; and [open] because the most likely reason to style [open] is that you're trying to do something for when it's open vs when it's not",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:52): but i agree that this argument is weak",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (11:52): it seems stupid to hook that styling off muted=&quot;&quot;, and anyway youtube would want to use a different video stream for those to save bandwidth, and could just remove the audio stream altogether and not bother with muted=&quot;&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:53): yeah i'm not saying it'd be a good idea",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (11:54): what if the author only has the main video and wants to style it specially when it's muted",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (11:54): we could introduce :muted for that, but having [muted] just work is simpler",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:55): that argues for exposing the entire API in content attributes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:55): i'm not sure that's a reasonable line of argumentation",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:57): the styling would only be affected if the user agent remembered the muted settings, I wonder how likely such a scenario is",

        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (12:05): although a form taken together can take a long time to fill, while muting a video is trivial",
