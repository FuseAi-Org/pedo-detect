        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (18:56): how do you call an object that might be initialized only once and then it's passed between modules by reference?",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (18:56): could this fall under the definition of singleton?",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (19:02): is there a way to prevent prototype from being used more than once?",
        "0acb83f1a9cfc48f061ff5555e61c6bf (19:04): c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6: module itself is a singleton?",
        "0acb83f1a9cfc48f061ff5555e61c6bf (19:04): c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6: don't think like Java :)",

        "0acb83f1a9cfc48f061ff5555e61c6bf (19:05): good for you :)",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (19:05): 0acb83f1a9cfc48f061ff5555e61c6bf: I just had this idea that by using this pattern I could completely eliminate global variables",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (19:06): e.g. instead of having window.settings object for sharing settings between all modules I could create one instance of settings after app launch and then load it from other modules with require()",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (19:07): I mean there is no require() on client-side by default, but I guess you know what I mean",
        "169e53c0dea6acddaff000780ee003b7 (19:09): hello guys, i have one problem... i have a table where each TD is canvas (just has to be like this). i generate table with javascript and i dont put canvas inside. when i want to put it, i first get width and height of td and create canvas inside that td with the same size. why does my TD size increase? (it goes from like 280 to 390)",

        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (19:20): 0acb83f1a9cfc48f061ff5555e61c6bf: in the pattern that I'm thinking about the second require() should return reference to the object returned by first require()",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (19:21): so that there should be only one instance of the object in the whole app",
        "c63a5cfce0a1819ebbe4a19e074356b6 (19:21): alternatively, the second require could return error",

        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (19:31): i don't know about &lt;canvas&gt; much, but it's always a bit intriguing the ways people are trying to use it",
        "9f873a67efcfe48cac10405dc48d2263 (19:33): Indeed. I'm personally using it as a way to detect touch detection of irregular shapes on a map, and then manipulating the shape once it is touched",
        "9f873a67efcfe48cac10405dc48d2263 (19:35): Kind of an advanced &lt;map&gt; function",
