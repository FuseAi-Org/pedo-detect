        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (13:50): for the window.foreignXHR = otherWindow.XMLHttpRequest case I'd expect window.document to be the Document pointer",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (13:50): It's good to know nothing goes on in the w3c that needs hiding",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (13:51): the PFWG should really be public, not sure why it isn't",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (13:52): Oh, I would never suggest such a thing, merely that we might want insight in their wisdom",
