        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:30): Can the lack of chatter about the Compatibility design principal be taken to mean people are done arguing it?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:31): I hope so",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:31): but probably not",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (09:35): I have trouble with that, because I really can't understand an abstract desire to break compatibility, independent of a specific list of changes and benefits",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:40): I don't understand David's objection to Don't Reinvent the Wheel",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:40): that's such a common design principle used everywhere, I didn't expect anyone to object to it",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (09:48): I find his latest email unreadable",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:48): I thought his demonstration of abusing a table to draw an image, as evidence that canvas reinvented the wheel, was quite amusing",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:49): well... Hixie did have an animated person done with nothing but HTML elements if I remember right",

        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:50): 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884, I know, I was being sarcastic",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (09:51): 8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc: no idea",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:52): ah, I'll look for a ticket then",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:53): that canvas demo is awesome",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:54): but my mac is too slow to run it well,though my PC was fast enough to run it at the large size",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:55): got it beginning of 2006",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:55): It can't possibly be too slow to run that",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:55): it's a Mac mini, before Intel CPUs came out",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (09:56): it runs it, it's just a bit jumpy",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:57): Aside from the rounding bug where you can mess up the rendering in Safari and the layout issues it runs pretty well for me",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (09:57): 14-20fps",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (10:05): I discovered yesterday that Safari doesn't default to UTF-8 for XML, which is a bug (though I expect it's a known bug)",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (10:06): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, you can cause it by walking from the starting position until you're right on the step out of the blue area and doing a 360 too",

        "c52919e46d9f68c9dc04880af9af834d (10:28): Resizing the canvas with the tiny-&gt;ultra links corrects it most of the time",
