        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:28): I've got tomcat 4.1 and want to implement single sign on",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:28): 4.1?",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:28): wow, talk about old",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:28): good old working stable tomcat :)",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:28): You got the old part right.  :)",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:29): OK. When I define a login method of my application I point some page",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:29): I don't want to duplicate that page across web apps",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:29): What is the best way of doing that",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:30): One thing that comes to my mind is to rewrite that jsp as a servlet",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:30): scriptlets are teh suck",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:30): and have that servlet class accessible from all apps",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:30): as for single sign on, have all webapps point to the single login page",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:30): easiest to do single signon with basic auth, imo",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:31): just have everyone use the same realm",

        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:31): I need some fancy page ;)",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:31): it'd be cool if basic auth could be implemented as form auth...",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:32): Any ideas?",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:32): You can use form based auth.",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:32): jasonb: I already use it",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:32): jasonb but that doesn't easily apply to sso",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:32): unless you have something to share the cookies, etc. across webapps",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:32): pfn: It's supposed to.",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:32): but I guess tomcat has an sso valve",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:32): guys the problem is not in implementing sso",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:33): Yup",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:33): I just don't want to duplicate my login.jsp across web apps",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:33): in web.xml I have to use relative jsps right",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:33): Is it possible to have login.jsp globally?",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:34): no",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:34): Vanuatoo: You can make your webapps cross context also, and then from each webapp include the login page of a single webapp when the user isn't logged in.",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:34): At least, in 5.5 you can.  :)",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:35): OK I will try that",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:35): I dislike &quot;app-server&quot; specific hacks...  :(",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:35): But I have to write scriptlet right",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:35): good thing I don't need to do that",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:35): When I have sso all apps share the same session right",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (22:36): each webapp should have a separate session...",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:36): and only principal info is stored automatically ?",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:36): .. but the same SSO session cookie.",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:36): ok",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:36): That's good",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:37): What about session timeout?",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:38): I think when one webapp's session expires for the user, all of them get expired for that user.",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:38): that's right",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:38): but there is one little problem",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:38): For example I have two apps and both of them have 30mins of timeout",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:39): I work in one app for 29 mins and than switch to the second and work in the second for 15 mins",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:39): When I switch back to my first app will it be expired?",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:39): Nope.",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:40): So session timeout value updates for all sessions in sso domain",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:40): Yes.",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:40): syncroniously",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:40): That's perfect",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (22:43): It wouldn't be real useful if it didn't work like that.",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:52): Simple scriptlet solved my problem :)",

        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:56): When I point to some protected resource tomcat redirects me to the login page and after successful authentication and authorization it gives me access to that page",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:56): Is it possible to redirect flow to some other page after success?",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:57): You know I've got the following pattern. I've got main page with the menu and links to some operations",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:58): But when the new user tries to access some intermediate page I want to authenticate him and send to the main page",
        "b80223aee94b0649c4d5fc716ac81f44 (22:58): regardless of what resource it types in the url bar of the browser",

        "95a764629d4525c4e7cc853963a91ffa (23:08): is it possible to use tomcat 5.5 with eclipse-wtp-2.0?",
        "95a764629d4525c4e7cc853963a91ffa (23:09): it seems wtp tries to load dynamic web module 2.5 and tomcat does not have it",
        "2a78e4ddb897d821d45a3ba9ce2078d5 (23:10): Vanuatoo: It is possible to do that, but there is no automatic facility of either Tomcat or the servlet API to make it happen, so you must cleverly script it somehow.  Lots of webapps are written to do this.",
        "95a764629d4525c4e7cc853963a91ffa (23:11): I can load the module wit wtp-1.0",
