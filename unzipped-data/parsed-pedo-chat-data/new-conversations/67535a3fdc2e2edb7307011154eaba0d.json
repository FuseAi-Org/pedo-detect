        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:34): While what I'm about to say might be a taboo, have you people made a poll with the users on this channel about what they're currently using, be it RDFa or Microdata?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (20:34): Is it important to do so?",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:35): Statistics are always important, whether you take them into account or not.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (20:35): Statistics of a random chat room probably aren't.  ^_^  Usage on the web is.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:36): Well, the poll would be about people using it.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:36): ._.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:38): 3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e, you didn't even mention microformatting.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:38): That's like not including Google :)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (20:38): Microformats are already part of HTML, though.  We're talking *dedicated* metadata embedding formats.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:38): Well, to be &quot;impartial&quot;, let's include Microformatting, though I don't like it that much.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:38): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb, well maybe everyone is okay with that.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:39): Besides, I guess usage shows a bigger RDFa user-base than Microdata, given their age.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:40): Say 1000 people use one of those three; 300 use microdata, 200 use RDFa, and 500 use microformatting --- disregarding microformatting is strange --- because they're all trying to accomplish the same functionality.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:40): It's not like comparing people that don't do anything to people that do something --- you should try to include all popular &quot;something&quot;s.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:41): Hmm... though it's an example, you mention at least 300 people using Microdata. Has user-base really grown that much?",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:41): I mean, in general.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:41): The internet is SERIOUS BUSINESS 3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e!",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (20:45): In any case, Microformats are not defined by their embedding.  They're a structure to apply to data.  They happened to use an embedding method built around existing HTML4 syntax, because that's what was available at the time, but writing an hcard in Microdata or RDFa is still using Microformats.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:45): I guess in the end it's better to have multiple &quot;supported&quot; options, than to have one unsupported.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (20:46): That's kind of why I don't like Microformats.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:50): It's kinda what the class attribute was designed to do.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:51): Not that I'm against Microdata or RDFa, even though they kill unicorns.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (20:51): Well, yes and no.  Class isn't necessarily supposed to be communicating anything meaningful to the outside world.  It's meant for private communication between the page author and their tools.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:52): RDFa has nicer documention and adoption than Microdata IMHO.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (20:54): While I, on the other hand, find Microdata's overall syntax and data model to be immensely simpler and easier to write and read.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (20:56): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb, I bet I would feel the same way if the documentation wasn't such a unrainbow.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (21:19): Oh, damn, wait... if not even Internet Explorer recognizes HTML5 elements (&lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, etc.), how can I make print stylesheets work? :o",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (21:20): The IE printing problem is a hard one.  If print stylesheets working in IE is important to you, don't use HTML5 yet.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (21:21): Internet Explorer 8*",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (21:22): Yeah. It's not a problem for MY website, but if I were to ever code a website for someone else, I guess I'd have to switch back to &lt;div&gt;.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (21:22): I think that most people don't actually care how websites print, so you're probably okay.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (21:23): IE can handle the new elements just fine on the screen, with the createElement hack.",
        "3501532e992dae83a8bc6c811325317e (21:24): Yeah.",
