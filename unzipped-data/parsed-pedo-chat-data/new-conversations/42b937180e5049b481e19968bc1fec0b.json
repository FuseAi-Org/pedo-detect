        "eb8a98129bf103327310edbb5652fcee (21:14): On the latter question, yes, I will be in the IE team chat, immediately following the HTML WG call (I'm presuming Dan is chairing one.)",

        "eb8a98129bf103327310edbb5652fcee (21:17): in fact, I seem to recall personally saying it made a lot more sense as it was portable across schema, and having a few other people in the WG shout me down.  :)",
