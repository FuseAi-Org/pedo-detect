        "607c4806ca15b47dcc0effd779440d55 (04:00): jnoon_: also, in option 2, instead of using all of those variables, create your own type or use %ROWTYPE.  that would clean things up a bit",

        "607c4806ca15b47dcc0effd779440d55 (04:08): jnoon_: it depends on what *you* need.  incremental commits are good when you are ok with having a portion of the operation fail.",
        "607c4806ca15b47dcc0effd779440d55 (04:09): but that's defined more by the problem rather than any generic paradigm"
