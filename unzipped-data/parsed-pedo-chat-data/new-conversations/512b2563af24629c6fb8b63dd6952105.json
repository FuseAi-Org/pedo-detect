        "56607eaa4190eac4f5909ba9ef113c5a (23:33): I was wondering if anyone would know why I would get an ORA-00900 on a java ResultSetMetaData call. The query executed fine.",
        "d42300f7a6e94673052375c4c366b646 (23:36): manimal, did you resolve your issue?",
        "56607eaa4190eac4f5909ba9ef113c5a (23:36): nope",
        "56607eaa4190eac4f5909ba9ef113c5a (23:37): I googled the error.",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (23:37): Cause: The statement is not recognized as a valid SQL statement. This error can occur if the Procedural Option is not installed and a SQL statement is issued that requires this option (for example, a CREATE PROCEDURE statement). You can determine if the Procedural Option is installed by starting SQL*Plus. If the PL/SQL banner is not displayed, then the option is not installed.",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (23:37): Action: Correct the syntax or install the Procedural Option.",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (23:38): what is the query?",
        "56607eaa4190eac4f5909ba9ef113c5a (23:38): What is curious to me is that I would get that error on a query to the result set. no the actual query itself.",

        "56607eaa4190eac4f5909ba9ef113c5a (23:39): but when I do a ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData(); I get the error.",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (23:41): so the error resturns the result, with an error?",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (23:41): sorry, the function call*",
        "56607eaa4190eac4f5909ba9ef113c5a (23:41): the query does not raise the exception, the rs.getMetaData() call does.",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (23:41): ok",
        "56607eaa4190eac4f5909ba9ef113c5a (23:42): which makes no sense to me. the error has to do with queries, not metaData.",
        "3ffec51a960043816ffd39506a0f4898 (23:43): can ocfs2 contain any type of data? or only oracle databases ?",

        "37d2de30a27c46d835b1351ae69ab8be (00:17): DethKlok: that doesn't mean anything to me, what version numbers are we dealing with",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (00:18): why are you upgrading......./?",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (00:18): if your updating the kernel it might not even be supported",

        "015e8c0a3a6b44f6044165bb30f683b2 (00:24): cant seem to find much on it on the site other then recompiling the kernel with another module",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (00:24): well i guess it will be fine",
        "015e8c0a3a6b44f6044165bb30f683b2 (00:25): i mean is it bad habit to upgrade that ?",
        "015e8c0a3a6b44f6044165bb30f683b2 (00:25): as in if it aint broke dont fix it",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (00:27): yeah",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (00:27): unless its for security",

        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (00:28): but if u ever want support, and they havent said they support that kernel, they could just turn round and say its not supported",
        "607c4806ca15b47dcc0effd779440d55 (00:28): in fact, a backup agent on one of linux machines just died because of an update to glibc... yay",
        "015e8c0a3a6b44f6044165bb30f683b2 (00:30): says on their site that they support the patches/kernels from RHEL",
        "015e8c0a3a6b44f6044165bb30f683b2 (00:31): but i understand that upgrades can = stuff being broken",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (00:31): they also recommend to patch to the latest Patchset",
        "1c71954f13f66b85b556f6f7332b7500 (00:31): and sometimes it makes things worse!",

        "607c4806ca15b47dcc0effd779440d55 (00:31): DethKlok: just be cautious before updating.  the fact that you are asking questions now is a good thing :)",
        "015e8c0a3a6b44f6044165bb30f683b2 (00:32): id rather break it in the dev phase now before we go live with it",
