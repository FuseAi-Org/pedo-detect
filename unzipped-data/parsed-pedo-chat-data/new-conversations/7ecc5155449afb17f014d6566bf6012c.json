        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:42): is confused now",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:47): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: so whether UM covers all useful use cases is only really a relevant question if someone argues to rescind CORS or fail to advance it",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:50): that's their position",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:50): so I think it's relevant to discuss",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:56): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: would the correctness or wrongness of their position affect our willingness to publish the spec as FPWD?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:56): or even to advance it to Last Call?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:57): if we just want UM features we can do that easily with CORS already",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:57): by just passing an anon origin if the right flags are passed to XHR2",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:57): and setting the credentials flag to false",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:58): so if they're wrong we don't need UM as we can just put it on top XHR2/CORS with a paragraph of extra text or so",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:59): sure, CORS could define a UM mode by having suitable mode flags",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:59): (besides the credentials flag I guess it would need an origin flag)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:02): I see",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:03): so UM is basically the no-credentials no-origin profile of CORS",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:03): (except that the current version does not do preflight either",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:04): yeah, preflight would automatically work with &quot;CORS-UM&quot;",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:05): at least the text is somewhat less misleading",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:08): too much work",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:08): already",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:09): I expect the spec requirement doesn't work for WebGL",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:29): although I am not sure what happens when you try to switch",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:32): i'll be happy to change teh spec to whatever the webgl guys think it should say",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:33): whether that is that getContext('3d') should blow away the bitmap, or getContext() for anything should do so, or getContext() should switch to a different bitmap, or whatever",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:34): i guess you should just have a concept of a context that reserves the bitmap",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:34): other specs define whether they are such a context",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:34): lets call the context x",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:35): you have to worry about getContext(x) on something with a non-x context and about invoking non-x or different x on an already active x",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:36): in the latter case, should be able to attach the removed context again later somehow?",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:36): actually, in both cases you have that",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:36): doh",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:36): should it be only on getContext(x), or if you save a context and use its methods does that also affect the bitmap?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:37): like if you save copies of 2d and webgl contexts, and alternately call methods from one or the other",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:37): it only affects if the context is &quot;active&quot; i believe",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:37): no idea what happens with the inactive one though",
