        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (00:39): since the HTML WG is so openly hostile, he's decided to become more hostile and more open about his hostility?",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:41): i wonder what Opera did wrong",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:42): or the other browser vendors for that matter",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (00:42): hmm. just about every jibe about html4all on IRC has been based on the irony of &quot;IRC cabal&quot; and actually having a secret mailing list",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:43): yeah, nothing is really based on any technical issues afaict",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:44): they can call us the &quot;IRC cabal&quot; but laughing about their private mailing list is not allowed... oh well, don't think it's my problem",
        "52b4ba716fdb258a8b7cea876731b549 (00:44): There have been occasions where I thought it'd be good to comment on technical issues they've mentioned on their list, but it's hard to do that when you can't post to it",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:51): i wonder which &quot;closed small group&quot; he's referring to",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:52): clearly not the whatwg (800+ people and open), nor the #whatwg (the pinacle of openness, with self-hosted archives)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:52): unless he has a new definition of &quot;closed&quot; that i am not aware of",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:52): It can be socially closed even if it's technically open",

        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (00:55): it seems that DanC just wants *more* editors, not to replace the existing ones",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:57): anyway, as far as i can tell this is just john playing us",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (01:03): i think it was &quot;spotted&quot; because @html4all.org was cc'ed in some e-mail or something",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (01:04): http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20070824#l-227 seems to be the first mention of the wiki, presumably via Referer",
        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (01:06): so why is html4all trying to remove the editor of... no don't answer that",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (01:11): I expect they're not a unified monolithic group with a single set of principles that they all agree on, so it's probably better to wonder why certain people want something rather than why the group does",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (01:23): heh, http://www.royal-tunbridge-wells.org/ longdesc= points to a non-existing URL...",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (01:23): maybe I should e-mail an open letter",
        "d114be1698421a7cec050e2207d29631 (01:25): i looked at the html of that page a while ago, i think when we were being called lazy and stupid, it didn't inspire me ...",
