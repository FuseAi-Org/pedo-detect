Much like an app can have multiple &quot;styles&quot; for different resolutions, the OS will be fully capable of scaling to any realistic screen size.&quot;",
        "1ef17f7652e4f736bfc0a5f707a78e21 (01:34): so Ice Cream is 3.1",
        "1ef17f7652e4f736bfc0a5f707a78e21 (01:34): I think that clears it up",
