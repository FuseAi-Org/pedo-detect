        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (01:42): when you create a menu item, you are creating a qaction",

        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (01:43): you might make your own custom slot that does stuff.. or you could connect it to a slot on your dialog, like exec() or whatever",
        "aab267d05db3d6ad5843d69de13bc4c9 (01:43): I'm looking at that.  How do I make it open a dialog though?  I guess this question is unrelated to the menu",
        "aab267d05db3d6ad5843d69de13bc4c9 (01:43): exec?  okay",
        "aab267d05db3d6ad5843d69de13bc4c9 (01:47): do QActions need parents?",
        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (01:53): yes, i think they do, but why do you need to know that? your menu item is a qaction already",
        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (01:53): so you don't have to manually create a qaction",
        "aab267d05db3d6ad5843d69de13bc4c9 (01:58): I don't?  uh...  I thought that would be easier, because I don't know where it would tie my signals otherwise",
        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (02:00): you would tie it in your code",

        "aab267d05db3d6ad5843d69de13bc4c9 (02:01): you mean in designer?",
        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (02:01): if you added a menu item named 'asdf', then the action is probably named 'actionAsdf'",

        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (02:02): of course",
