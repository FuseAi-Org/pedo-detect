        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:29): Question about the media API: Seeking works by setting currentTime to a new value (in seconds). Is there a special reason why currentTime isn't readonly and seeking works e.g. with a method seek(), taking a relative value (zero to one), which would cover the case when the duration of the stream isn't known (but it's filesize is) and rough seeking shall still be available.",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:29): s/./?",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:30): (there are media formats without a header containing duration, so all you got is the byte position if the client shouldn't try to find a timestamp at the end of the bytestream)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:31): zero to one relative to the filesize?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (16:31): (seeming the length isn't known)",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:32): yeah, if the duration in &quot;proper time&quot; isn't known one can still seek to an approximate position using the position of the bytestream",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:33): this, however, only works if seeking is not taking absolute time. The client can then find a fitting representation",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:34): if duration is known: Seek to the position (in seconds or whatever)",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:34): if only the length of the bytestream is known: Well, just jump to a position in there",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:35): I'm currently trying to implement a subset of the HTML5 media specs for a Java playback applet, which only knows bytepositions and thus always seeks relative",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:37): I *could* estimate the total duration in seconds given the current byteposition and the current timestamp the media stream has",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:38): but that means the duration will change during playback (and given how dynamic video bitrate is this estimate can be like 1000% off)",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:38): (the estimate will first be horrible and be more accurate at the end)",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:39): this isn't just specific to this applet thingie, but for some formats the clients really have to seek to the end of the file and find a timestamp befor the duration is known",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (16:40): it's why doublec has asked for a duration attribute",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:40): ah, I see :)",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:40): same solution as for my applet ;-)",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (16:40): not sure it will come though - and whether it's a good solution, because not every author may include that info",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:40): most won't",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (16:41): yeah, so the estimate is probably the best you can do",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:41): quite frankly I'd hope that currentTime would be currentPosition, which can either be seconds *or* byte position",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:41): and a flag indicating what it is",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:41): same for duration",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:42): but this smells like a hack",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (16:42): or a value marker (e.g. sec,B)",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (16:42): has radically simplified his Public-HTML message filter: it now marks everything without me in either the To or CC line as Read.",
        "99a3bfa1a9430e7df6358b5f3e9e1e17 (16:42): right",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (16:43): well, width/height take pixels, em and other entities, too",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (16:43): why not currentPosition",
