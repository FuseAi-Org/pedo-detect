        "f9037a9c6400778870d82eb83d4f5f0c (04:24): there are many modes of wireless.  adhoc and infrastructer being examples",
        "f9037a9c6400778870d82eb83d4f5f0c (04:24): well, you have to share the connection you are on if you do laptop to desktop",
        "f9037a9c6400778870d82eb83d4f5f0c (04:24): that is in settings as well",
        "405e5b8969ede6e7940bd64366a9a50b (04:25): it just connects to my little computer-to-computer network and says &quot;whoopee&quot;",
        "405e5b8969ede6e7940bd64366a9a50b (04:25): and nothing happens after that",
        "405e5b8969ede6e7940bd64366a9a50b (04:25): Fatb0y: hmm",
        "f9037a9c6400778870d82eb83d4f5f0c (04:25): go to your wired connection and say share to airport or whatever the option may be",
        "f9037a9c6400778870d82eb83d4f5f0c (04:25): and then you can surf all you want through your imac from your laptop",
        "405e5b8969ede6e7940bd64366a9a50b (04:26): cool",
        "f9037a9c6400778870d82eb83d4f5f0c (04:26): so that way you dont have to buy a wireless router for now anyway",
        "405e5b8969ede6e7940bd64366a9a50b (04:26): right",
        "f9037a9c6400778870d82eb83d4f5f0c (04:26): the only drawback is your imac must be on at all times",
