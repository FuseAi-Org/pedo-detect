        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:18): unless they all have windows that line up, and are always open",

        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:18): what if you had a crazy powerful antenna of some sort",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:19): sure it won't be legal",
        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:19): do you have site to site LOS from the roof ridge ?",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:19): then you could go farther",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:19): but a lot of shit i do is illegal",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:19): also, you can be legal with quite big antennas as long as its P2P",
        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:19): stiv2k: true you could, but walls and trees are good at limiting your options",

        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:19): its against FCC",

        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:20): eiggirC: the FCC crack,",

        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:20): its transmission power",

        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:20): 18:17 &lt; DrDT&gt; also, you can be legal with quite big antennas as long as its P2P",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:21): well my friend lives 2 houses down",
        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:21): or did you mean point to point?",

        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:21): i wonder if a pair of simple cantennas pointed at eachother would work",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:21): what other p2p would apply to antenna output power?",
        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:21): DrDT: well its still total transmisison power, regardless if its across the room or across the road or suburb or whatever",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:21): 2 houses isn't that far...",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:21): eiggirC: obviously",
        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:21): DrDT: yeah actually read &quot;p2p&quot; and thought filesharing",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:21): and that tx power can be quite higher if it's p2p",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:21): instead of p2mp",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:22): well, lurk moar dammit",
        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:22): DrDT: -grin-",
        "995b15da895d895b607cb0175432d850 (11:22): as long as its legal you're safe.",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:22): it says you can go up to 48dbm if it's p2p and you reduce your amp output by whatever amount you add to the antenna... IIRC 1dbm less amp output for each 3dbm antenna gain",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:24): which means, again IIRC (I'm tired) that you're legal with a p2p setup with each end at 24dbm amp output and 24dbi antenna gain",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:24): which is a huge-ass amount of power for the wireless we do",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:24): you could easily punch through a few houses with that",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:25): stiv2k: you could try cantennas, but I'd say you might as well go to 19dbi (or 24dbi, but they're huge) dishes to get lots of signal",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:25): yeah",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:26): but i dont wanna spend hundreds of dollars for that",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:26): i made a cantenna",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:26): 19s aren't that much",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:26): i can pick up a bunch of networks",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:26): but none of them are strong enough to connect to it seems",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:26): you can't trust the gain on a home-made cantenna much",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:26): hehe",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:26): im just experimenting",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:26): esp. if you're not experienced at doing it",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:26): uh",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:26): &quot;pick up&quot; in kismet or netstumbler?",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:27): kismet",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:27): oops",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:27): netstumbler i mean",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:27): ok, if you said Kismet I'd say don't consider that a proof of your antenna",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:28): kismet is receive-only, so if your antenna had a high SWR (bad) you wouldn't notice it much.",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:28): no, i don't like kismet",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:28): i've used it though",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:28): but i used netstumbler in this case",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:28): but netstumbler broadcasts, so if you can pick up stuff it means you're at least transmitting not-bad.",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:29): DrDT: in windows wireless zero thing...the highest signal strength i got was 1 bar",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:29): and it wouldn't connect",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:29): stiv2k: that measure is useless.",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:29): i have heard somewhere that it doesnt matter how poweful your antenna is,",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:29): it's card-specific",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:29): if the AP isn't powerful enough to hear your packets, it wont work",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:29): or something along those lines",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:30): that would be wrong, antenna is very important, and you get tx gain as well as RX",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:30): someone in this channel said that",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:30): stiv2k: good, having a good chipset is important",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:30): yeah",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:30): i spent 70 bucks on it",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:30): i hope i can make it worth it",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:31): alright, so theoretically, would it be possible to build/buy an antenna to connect to a friend's network without having to have them put an antenna on their side",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:31): stiv2k: possibly, but that's hard",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:31): DrDT: while it is atheros, its weak",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:31): it says like 65mw on the datasheet",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:31): DrDT: like i said they live only 2 houses down",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:32): i want to use as little equip. as possible",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:32): stiv2k: that's because you got a cheapy one, that's a usual power for cheapy atheros",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:32): $70 is cheapy?",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:32): heh",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:32): and if you're going through a few houses it'll be unlikely to happen without an antenna at their end",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:32): stiv2k: yes",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:33): i wanna mess around with more homemad antennas before i move onto commercial ones",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:33): 2 houses you can probably do with only good quip. at your end, as long as their cards/antennas aren't complete crap.",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:33): i believe its a linksys WRT54g",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:33): a good PC card costs 130$US (ubiquiti atheros 300mw)",

        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:34): stiv2k: WRT54Gs have broadcom chipsets which aren't great",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:34): but you can try it",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:34): i didn't know the chipset mattered",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:34): you should expect it... rf design is hard",
        "abc06c0a7619edcdce38996e38b1d01a (11:34): what's a good router?",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:35): apparently other than the radio the wrt54g series are good, except for the vxworks ones",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (11:36): I consider D-link the least crappy cheap router brand, although they've had a few crap ones, and Linksys is pretty close.",
