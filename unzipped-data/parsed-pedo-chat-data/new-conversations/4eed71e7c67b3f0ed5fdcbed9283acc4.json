        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:42): 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: i sent you email",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:43): 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: i like most of the new logical property stuff but i hate the terms &quot;measure&quot; and &quot;length&quot;",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:43): would rather go back to logical-width and logical-height",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:43): heh",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:43): I would prefer length, but I can't come up with an alternative to measure",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:44): line-direction-length, block-direction-length",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:44): that's not making it less akward",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:44): anyway the reason i like logc ical width and logical height",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:44): awkward",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:44): is that the code in webkit stays very readable",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:44): like you can still stare at layout code and see it talking about the logical left of a line",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:45): or the logical top + logical height etc",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:45): so someone just reading it can kind of filter it out and just think horizontal lines",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:45): anyway just giving my feedback.  like the other stuff.",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:46): i think logical-width/height are good terms though and should just keep them",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:46): especially if we do the logical keyword for shorthands",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:46): k",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:46): I mainly put them in to see the reaction :)",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:47): hm, speaking of which, I need to cut that entire section out so I can requestion FPWD",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:47): s/ion//",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:47): there's really two aspects to these terms",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:47): (it's bedtime here)",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:47): there's the css properties",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:47): but then there is what term you use all over your code",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:47): i guess the two could be different",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:47): but i like that they matched (logicalwidth property, logicalwidth term etc)",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:48): ok i won't bother you",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:48): night :)",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:48): hm, not seeing your email",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:48): i just sent it to you",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:48): not to thel ist",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:48): yeah, that's where I'm looking...",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:49): You could make them match either way",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:49): It's just a problem that the only alternative to width is breadth, which nobody can spell right",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:50): remembers to check the other email address",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:52): lol",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:52): i just think logical-width/height are fine terms",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:52): 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: i sent a post out about the baseline issue",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (23:52): with details about wjhat WinIE does",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:53): from what I heard at TPAC, what WinIE does isn't necessarily a good idea",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:53): but I don't remember the details",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:53): all I know is, I need to spend a couple days writing up that section",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:54): I have a fuzzy idea of how it's supposed to work from talking with some of the Adobe guys at TPAC",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:54): so I'm going to work that out and see if what I understood all fits together",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:55): but basically, my approach is to not touch the vertical-align property's default",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:55): and define baseline behavior for vertical to behave appropriately",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:55): for textual contents",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:56): but koji said something about ...",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:56): oh bother",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:56): I don't think I can say anything intelligent right now.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (23:56): :)",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:16): lol",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:17): i was going to suggest just doing the right thing when you encounter ideographs",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:17): on a line",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:19): that's the plan",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:19): &quot;just do the right thing&quot;",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:20): it's a matter of figuring out the right thing and making a coherent spec out of it :)",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:20): or render upright",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:20): is converting lists right now",

        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:20): i honestly have no idea",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:21): i am inclined to just keep them upright like other images",

        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:22): i think a japanese author would assume they would render upright",
