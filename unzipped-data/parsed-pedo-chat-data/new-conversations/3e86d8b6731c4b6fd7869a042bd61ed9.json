        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:39): well i'm not sure if my system is actually too hot or if the thermometers are misreading",
        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:40): i'm okay with the software side of things but hardware is something i need to learn :)",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (16:40): you might beable to 'calibrate' temp sensors but replace them, well a lot are surface mount or even on-die :(",
        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:41): right well, according to my BIOS, only one fan (the system fan) is operating",

        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:47): whenever I ask the system to do anything remotely strenuous, the temp reaches 110C and the system cuts out :)",
        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:48): i.e. the comp is useless",

        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (16:49): maybe the thermal paste has dried up or walked away",

        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:51): which is still hot",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (16:51): once at 110C = dead core",
        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:51): so I know, what should I be aiming for?",
        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:51): well it's not dead",

        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:51): right",
        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:51): would the local comp shop be able to fix something like this?",
        "9ed5df709f4498d8eee49426aafe1664 (16:52): it's out of warranty",
