        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:00): actually i should revisit the spec, i'm getting &quot;&quot; for folders, dropping an image gets the right type",
        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:01): a better question is, can i determine if a dropped file is a folder or not?",

        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:20): 976c3ffadc0468d18d4aca16e4353cac: yeah, my issue is that i can't work with folders with html5 dnd",
        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:20): isn't this kind of a huge oversight for most situations when people would want to drop something",
        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:20): input type=file with multiple is great for selecting multiple files, but drag and drop seems relatively suited for folders",
        "976c3ffadc0468d18d4aca16e4353cac (04:20): yeah, there is also a bug with dropping a folder on an input file with webkitdirectory",

        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:48): so its really unstable",
        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:49): was talking to a guy in #node.js who had worked on this project tempisfugit but is too busy to finish it",
        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:49): so i'm working on making a node/client side implementation of git",
        "976c3ffadc0468d18d4aca16e4353cac (04:49): yeah I'd love to jump back into C++ dev, I didn't really move beyond hello world as a teenager",
        "976c3ffadc0468d18d4aca16e4353cac (04:50): ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402: nice, sounds like a cool project",

        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:51): basically what i'm doing now is including the built library, and then including a compatibility layer",
        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:51): which i hope others will copy the style and create their own",

        "976c3ffadc0468d18d4aca16e4353cac (04:54): why not do indexedDB seems like more powerful git like stuff",
        "ea4cd2f0efef9310f548e4f684415402 (04:55): that'd be cool too, i just know how to use localStorage, but not indexDB",
        "976c3ffadc0468d18d4aca16e4353cac (04:55): could be a good reason to learn it",
