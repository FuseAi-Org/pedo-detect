        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:37): anyone know how far [roughly] a 700mw transmitter would go in a hilly / wooded area?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:38): at what frequency?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:38): at what height?",
        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:38): 2.4ghz (802.11g?)",
        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:39): at what elevation is the site, or at what elevation is the antenna?",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:39): you tell us",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:39): well",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:39): 2.4, no matter what power, has a really hard time penetrating trees",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:39): and will *not* penetrate dirt.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:40): if you can't realistically see whatever you're trying to hit, you can pretty much forget 2.4 or any other microwave frequency working for you.",
        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:40): so what's the next best thing?",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:40): try 900MHz",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:41): though it doesn't push dirt either",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:41): yeah, and foliage does 'hurt' it, just not as much.",
        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:41): i basically have to go about 1000 feet...  site a is about 300 ft below site b",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:41): oh, 1000' isn't bad",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:41): oh",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:41): how thick is the foliage in between?",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:41): why don't you just try the 2.4GHz radios then?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:42): 2.4 ghz radios + good directional antennas pointed properly = teh win",
        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:42): it's mostly oak and manzanita, but pretty thick..",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:42): if that doesn't work... I'd say get some SR9's and some SBCs that can properly handle them.",
        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:42): so doesn't require line of sight when it's that close?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:42): well",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:42): you can penetrate *some* foliage",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:42): yeah",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:42): theres a big difference between say, 10 miles, and 1000 ft.",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:42): the trees will attenuate the signal",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:43): not completely block it",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:43): attenuate with absorbtion and multipath",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:43): as long as you have enough reaching the receiver you should be ok",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:43): yep",
        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:44): next question, where do i get this stuff?  it's obviously not stuff you get at best buy",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:44): many places",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:44): for simple stuff like this I suggest linksys wrt54gl's, openwrt or dd-wrt, and good antennas.",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:44): i get a lot of stuff from bizsyscon.com",
        "f885ff222384af76169c91feb69fd288 (05:45): they have a good deal on the SR9 right now too",
        "9ccb999806cc0e065a5d80dfb0f0d3eb (05:46): huh...  does the sr9 work with WRAP?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:46): geekfound: yes, but you'll need an OS that does 5 or 10 mhz channels.  SR9 on 20 mhz sucks.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (05:47): Routerboard 112s are a better deal anyways.",
