        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:34): hey there. how can i tell blender that i want a bezier circle to be in Z: 0.00 ?",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:34): put the cursor there and snap it or create it there?",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:35): use shift-s to snap",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:38): darn... it doesn't do what i want it to",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:39): i'm trying to create a logo from a 2d bitmap",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:39): you could autotrace it in inkscape and then import it",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:39): oh thanks!",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:40): check out the wiki docs. there's more info about curves",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:40): does inkscape work good on circles?",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:40): cause i have an outlining circle that is giving me problems when i make one for the inner and one for the outer circle",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:40): tracing by hand yields better results normally",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:41): if you create a another circle inside circle or whatever cyclic curve, it cuts that area out",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:42): *-a",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:44): yeah, i've tried that, but the inside area isn't being cut out",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:44): a screenshot would help",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:46): <a href=\"http://img423.imageshack.us/my.php?image=logotest3pa.jpg\">http://img423.imageshack.us/my.php?image=logotest3pa.jpg</a>",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:47): here the circles are cut out, but the inner and outer circle are both altered when i try to scale and movethe inner circle",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:49): Woxxy: i would use mesh to model that. curves are good for more complex shapes. that's just a matter of taste though",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:50): it may be that you had bad selection. select one handle of a circle and hit l to select the rest",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:51): yeah, i think it's a bad selection, too. the inner circle isn't supposed to affect the outer circle at all",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (19:51): thanks, i'll retry",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (19:54): Woxxy: fast way to do the outline would be to first make a curvecircle and match it to edges of the picture and then duplicate it with shift-d and scale to match the other edges with s key",
        "d3b120294c368abbf695fabf42c5737f (19:55): Hi! Is there some way to copy a projection of some current view as an UV map into the UV/image editor?",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (19:59): huh? you can unwrap by view",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (20:00): thanks BeBraw, got it now",
        "aac5a080ab55ed52b876625970be765d (20:00): Woxxy: great :)",
        "39eb6d86cca8d392142c50a88f353d8b (20:01): another thing though: when i render, how do i set the background color?",
        "77f645b77afe20413fa3cb3d5a633537 (20:01): hey how do i make the curser snap to the center?",
        "77f645b77afe20413fa3cb3d5a633537 (20:02): Woxxy, there is a world button in renders",
        "77f645b77afe20413fa3cb3d5a633537 (20:02): no it is in materials,     it is the blue and white orb",
        "9013eb5d0e7957f879db7c05bda6f4d1 (20:05): varsendaggr: press SHIFT+c",
        "d3b120294c368abbf695fabf42c5737f (20:06): bert: yep but that's not what I want.",
        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (20:07): variant: shift-c?",
        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (20:07): oh, someone said it already",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (20:08): sad to hear ...",
        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (20:08): and wrong target too",
        "d3b120294c368abbf695fabf42c5737f (20:08): bert:basically I have drawn some shape with some picture as a template, now I want to use exacty that picture as a texture map.",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (20:10): the surface of the shape is one plane?",
        "d3b120294c368abbf695fabf42c5737f (20:11): not exactly, I used another picture to add depth.",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (20:11): if so, make an orthogonal projection unwrap and export the uv layout and put your image onto it",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (20:11): ah, okay",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (20:12): well, then you can't put just one image on it anyway",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (20:12): or, you can, but it will get stretched",
        "d3b120294c368abbf695fabf42c5737f (20:13): how do I make an &quot;orthogonal projection unwrap&quot;?",
        "5b8f9b3ba8946ecdc32802b9eb4b5cdf (20:13): ShortWave!!",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (20:13): rtc: i just meant meant unwrap by view from side or front view or whatever",
        "8690e5336e61480e2d389ec0187b68d4 (20:15): -meant btw ;)",

        "1c86e4c07f1a7add8427337e0fb7963e (20:20): I build a chain of bones, create a seperate IK bone so this bone can be adressed by a constraint of the bone that should be moved, is that right?",
