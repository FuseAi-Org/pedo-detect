        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:04): Hello. I've been informed this:  https://identi.ca/conversation/30357151#notice-30442231 , https://identi.ca/conversation/30361063#notice-30446254 is not being worked on yet.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:07): So I'd like to officially suggest a File descriptors in File API. Basically, I need a feature of reading local files. file:// won't do because it's blocked, and limited. Data URI scheme isn't even a standard, and impractical.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:10): My example use scenario is an on-line Movie editor. A movie is too big to be uploaded or put into RAM, and besides, it cannot be manipulated that way - only played. A file descriptor could be used to edit a file that a user has selected (and allowed to be read and written to).",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:16): File API is also limited in so that even if it loads an entire video into main memory, it can't play it in the &lt;video&gt; tag.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:17): excuse the typos, i'm too lazy to fix them.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:19): awaits acknowledgement",
        "dd988cfd769c9f7fbd795a0f5da8e751 (17:22): thinks <email/> would probably work best that early on the US West Coast",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:23): it's not that early is it?",
        "dd988cfd769c9f7fbd795a0f5da8e751 (17:23): well, it's 7:20 PDT, isn't it?",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:23): perhaps it is, well you suggested it :-P",
        "dd988cfd769c9f7fbd795a0f5da8e751 (17:23): :)",
        "dd988cfd769c9f7fbd795a0f5da8e751 (17:24): mea culpa, maxima culpa",
        "dd988cfd769c9f7fbd795a0f5da8e751 (17:24): although I also suggested <email/>",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:24): yawns",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:25): ah, i'll do it later :-|",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:26): ach",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:26): feature requests should really be done on the mailing list",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:27): however, I think we might already have a draft that resembles the above",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:27): also, data URLs are a standard",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:27): oh? a useless one, then.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:27): ;-P",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:27): that seems somewhat shortsighted",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:28): but sure, maybe to you",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:28): it's an rfc, not a w3c standard, isn't it?",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:29): i think it's just a bad way to address the same problem. but i may be missing something, I don't know.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:29): http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-writer.html is closer to what you are looking for I guess",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:29): not all standards are created by the W3C",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:30): web standards?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:30): nope",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:31): there's that org that made WebGL, I know, but it wasn't until w3c adopted it that it gained in popularity",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:32): i'm skeptical about an rfc's authority.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:32): haha",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:33): fwiw, W3C has not adopted WebGL, and HTTP comes from the IETF",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:33): URLs are done by the IETF too",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:33): and various other features you use every single day",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:33): on the web",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:36): you're right about WebGL, I'll give you that.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:36): I mean I have to :-)",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:37): But what new RFC thing is widely used and considered a standard? HTTP and links are foundations of the web, we're talking web standards.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:37): so sleepy...",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:38): why are the foundations not web standards?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:38): but euh, JSON is hip these days I believe",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:38): *shrugs* I guess",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:40): anyway, before I fall asleep, I have one more question - if you know about it: The CDFF (something like that) - format/something for documents. What is it really and is it  hard to learn? How much would one that knows X/(H)TML, CSS, MathML etc need to study to get it?",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:41): (HT)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:41): Compound Document Formats WG?",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:41): yeah.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:41): that's sort of obsolete",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:41): but the idea of mixing HTML/MathML/SVG survived and is supported by browsers",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:41): obsolete as in dead horse obsolete, or obsolete as in there are new things, so it's abandoned?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:42): so I guess if you know how to do that...",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:42): but i thought CDDF was sort of a glue?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:42): obsolete as in the base specifications were clarified so the group no longer had a function",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:42): never did quite get what i need it for though.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:42): neither did we",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:42): it's CDF",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:43): interesting.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:45): i'm guessing SMIL is obsolete too, right?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:46): it tries to survive as part of SVG",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:47): oh, so that's that SVG's own animation lang i've been hearing about.",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:47): good, good.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:47): i don't think it's so good, but to each his own :)",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:47): it's not so good for SVG you mean?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (17:48): i think the CSS-based approach has more going for it",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:49): CSS does little for animation, don't you mean JS?",
        "a6282da967eba72f90fdaea6eaf28258 (17:50): but anyhow, SMIL was not appealing for its animation, it was appealing for its media manipulation, i doubt SVG can do what SMIL has supposed to",
