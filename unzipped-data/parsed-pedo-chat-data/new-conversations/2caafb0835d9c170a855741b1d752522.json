        "28cec2e778b63c424c3f689b92d7cb58 (01:23): I&apos;m just very forgetful. Constantly forgetting the simplest things - people consistently mistake it for laziness of lack of drive. I have a tendency to be what some would call &quot;typically dumb blonde&quot;, missing jokes, not remembering things I&apos;ve said or done.",

        "9620d1aa0b638f603055f33f6a8580bb (01:24): I think I can say the same in a lot of ways.",
        "9620d1aa0b638f603055f33f6a8580bb (01:24): For me it has mostly centered around other people.",
        "9620d1aa0b638f603055f33f6a8580bb (01:25): Being a loner, as I already stated, I feel like a lot of my duties as sibling, family member, and friend really just escaped me.",

        "9620d1aa0b638f603055f33f6a8580bb (01:25): And I feel like everyone just excuses it, maybe because they understand my personality.",
