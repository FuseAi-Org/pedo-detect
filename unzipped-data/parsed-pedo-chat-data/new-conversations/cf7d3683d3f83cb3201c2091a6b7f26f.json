        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:34): so I didn't want to move others' bugs to resolved and have somebody call process foul",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:45): there's about 40 of them at this point, I think",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:45): so I seen you started marking up the spec with topic annotations",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:46): I think that'll be useful",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:47): a few hours ago annevk was trying out that diff thing I suggested",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:47): for web-apps-tracker",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:47): and got it working",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:51): i should probably find a way to put them in the checkin comment, too",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:53): that is what TC39 is calling their locales API",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:54): it's kind of like when people started calling themselves &quot;serial entrepreneurs&quot;",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:54): and now serial whatevers",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:12): but I don't think they are consciously doing it for that reason",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:12): they are just naively saying, Hey, there's a word that sounds good",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (05:13): if people are implementing a localization framework who don't even know the word &quot;localization&quot;, i'd be very worried",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:13): without taking time to consider how the word it normally used in practice and what negative connotations it might have",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:13): no, they know the word localization",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:13): I think it's that what they are producing is not strictly about localization",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:14): it's more about what normally called &quot;locales&quot; support",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:14): and it seems like until recently most everybody had been calling the JS thing &quot;The Locales API&quot;",
