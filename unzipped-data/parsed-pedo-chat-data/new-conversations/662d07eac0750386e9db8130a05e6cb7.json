        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:18): Is it intended that platform objects have some hidden state that enables one to determine that they are platform objects?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:19): If so is it intended that e.g. a third party javascript library can never implement an IDL interface (since the browser wouldn't know how to check for the hidden flag)",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (10:20): &quot;An ECMAScript library that adds support for some Web API that is not natively supported by a browser would also be considered to expose platform objects.&quot;",

        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:21): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, how to determine whether a given object is considered to implement a given interface isn't defined exactly",

        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:21): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, but there is a requirement that say an object returned from `readonly attribute Node? parentNode;` is a platform object that implements Node",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:22): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, just because platform objects are the only things that can implement (non-callback) interfaces",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:23): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, tbh I was a bit lazy, and I think the concept of platform vs user objects could probably be eliminated, since they are always distinct anyway (user objects can't implement Node, platform objects can't implement EventListener)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:23): I am at least pretty sure than in the current state of the spec, the browser isPlatformObject check will basically amount to &quot;is this implemented natively in the browser&quot;",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (10:24): Sounds like the right thing to do",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:25): IIRC there is at least one situation where you need to take an arbitary object and determine if it is a platform object or not (overloading resolution with arrays, perhaps?)",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:25): &quot;natively in the browser&quot; is not exactly right; it's more like &quot;has some hidden state variable set that only the given implementation would know&quot;",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:25): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, there you need to know whether it is a native Array object (easy to check), a platform array object, or a platform object that also supports indexed properties",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:26): Either that is an equivalent statement or we will be in a bad state where some magic flags will have an effect on some browsers but not others",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:26): ok",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:26): there's probably a problem",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:26): let's say you have the native browser C++ implementation of some APIs",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:26): as well as a JS library that implements some other APIs",

        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:27): how is the C++ implementation to know that the JS library objects &quot;implements&quot; the IDL interface with indexed properties",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:27): or even what that other IDL interface is",

        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:28): I don't think it's possible then for a native C++ implementation and a JS library implementation of APIs to coexist",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:28): at least if they don't share knowledge about these internal state bits",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:30): I should probably remove mention of JS libraries implementing APIs, and talk more generally about it not mattering what languages (JS or C++) implements given interfaces, just that they need to share this internal state information",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:30): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, wdyt?",
        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (10:30): i don't see anything about ibooks on http://opensource.apple.com/",

Of course if some browser wants to implement their DOM APIs in javascript or a javascript/C++ mix, that should be possible",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:33): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, right so I think that's all I want to enable",
        "a3f19f90edf0a0893c7847d08016abe3 (10:33): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, i.e. avoid &quot;host object&quot; vs &quot;native object&quot; terminology",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:33): OK, so as long as it is clearly scoped to that, IO think it is fine",

        "8b7a8196348038c107614af0b08f2d21 (10:43): there's certainly some tension in the webkit community around these sorts of issues",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:04): in Fennec Native, I can't copy the URL at all, though :-)",
