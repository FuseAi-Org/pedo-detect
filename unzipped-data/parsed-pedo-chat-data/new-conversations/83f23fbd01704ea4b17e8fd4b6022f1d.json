        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:13): &quot;it's more accurate to just autodetect the language than to use the metadata&quot; - wouldn't it be even more accurate to use the metadata as an input to the autodetection heuristics, since there's bound to be a non-zero correlation between the metadata and the data and therefore it's better to use that input than to ignore it?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:30): How certain is that?",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:33): That the correlation is positive",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:36): Pretty certain - if lang is currently entirely random and unrelated to the actual language, then I just need to create a single web page which uses lang correctly, and then there'll be a positive correlation, and the only way it'd get back to zero correlation is if someone maliciously uploads a new page with an intentionally incorrect lang, which seems pretty unlikely",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:37): (and if they upload two incorrect pages, then there'll be a negative correlation, which you could usefully feed into your language autodetection heuristics so that your choice is biased away from the metadata because it's most likely to be incorrect)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:37): But we'd have to know which",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:38): There could be page creators with English hardcoded, e.g.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:39): If you have a million pages which say lang=&quot;en&quot; because it's hardcoded into the editor and is unrelated to the actual language, and one page that says lang=&quot;en&quot; because it's actually English, then the probability of a page being English given that it has lang=&quot;en&quot; is greater than the probability of it being English given no prior knowledge",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:41): It'd have to be significant enough to be useful",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:44): But it probably isn't that much",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:45): And even then there's the cost of figuring out how much weight to give it, and implement the weighting, and suffer from false positives when you overweight :)",
