        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (17:55): so it could download however much is needed for the resolution it's actually displaying at (and then resume the download to get more, if that changes)",

        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (18:01): for example, contextual images are an image where you would have a &quot;Logo + company name&quot; (let's say a 400 pixels banner) then when you reach a smaller screen, you want to display only the logo without the company name, (like a 100px square logo)",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (18:01): It is just an example.",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:02): i'd think you'd just have two images in that case, toggled on mutually exclusively with css, not a single image with src magic",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (18:02): like for example a rectangle image and you show a square crop at smaller size",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:03): yes, you can have three or four images, again with visibility controlled with css :)",
        "1f58faf0d058f303f30239a369808167 (18:03): because you can precisely target a very large screen, a tablet screen, a giant billboard, a desktop screen, etc.",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:03): (not ideal, since it won't work well if the stylesheet isn't loaded, but &quot;css is optional&quot; doesn't exactly work in practice very often anyway heh)",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:07): &lt;img&gt; is already way complex, adding some conditional resource loading on top of it used by a couple of authors is not worth it",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (18:08): I think characterising it as :a couple of authors&quot; is not very fair",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:10): i don't know anything about it; i'm asking since it sounds useless to me on first impression",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:10): handheld is an old concept, nearly obsolete",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (18:10): good :)",
        "efcfdc75e9299f9082b85c6f181b106f (18:11): But media queries are based on browser window size right?",
