        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:13): hello jazzrocker",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:14): nemik, hey nemik",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:14): nemik, i've got a link for you brb, lemme find it, in the meantime just work on vimtutor",

        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:15): thanks",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:19): nemik, hmmm, this is rather odd and unfortunate, the website that has/had that link has corrupted itself somehow",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:19): nemik, lemme find another way brb",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:20): nemik, ok you'll need to run this command on a terminal",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:20): nemik, sudo apt-get --purge remove vim",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:20): nemik, then you'll need to install the appropriate debs from <a href=\"http://www.freshnet.org/debian/dapper/vim7/\">http://www.freshnet.org/debian/dapper/vim7/</a>",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:21): to get the highlighting and all?",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:21): nemik, uhh, vim 7 has some various new features including better completion that you'll want",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:21): nemik, iirc 7 includes a fixed/better/patched PHP mode as well",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:22): nemik, the default vim on Ubuntu is 6.4 iirc",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:22): ok, thanks",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:23): nemik, i've also got a fairly nice vim config that i'm running on my vim 7 ubuntu box",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:23): nemik, simple and lightweight",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:23): nemik, PHP oriented mainly",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:23): and you use vim for php dev?",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:23): nemik, nothing but :)",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:23): nemik, ok, well i have to admit, i use the terminal sometimes... oh yeah and a web browser :)",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:24): nemik, literally there are just some text editing features/capabilities that vim has that i would be *lost* without on any other editor.",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:24): hmmm. well you talked me into it; the tutorial is going well",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:25): nemik, i've come across some stuff in my web dev experience that would have been near impossible without vim. just some gigantic text files that needed rearranging, etc",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:26): yea i have those too, ctrl+h in gedit just doesn't cut it sometimes",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:26): nemik, there is quite a bit more than what's just in the tutorial. the tutorial will get you to where you can actually use it. you should definitely read the user manual though, don't need to read it all in one sitting",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:26): nemik, but if you go through the user manual in the course of about a month you'll have your bearings very well and you'll be quite able to invent your own solutions to complicated problems you never thought solvable before :)",
        "2c9e93da49d5ee0039545fd834c14006 (11:27): anyone know what is the equivalent of the .vim directory in windows?",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:27): jzxu, &quot;vimfiles&quot;",
        "2c9e93da49d5ee0039545fd834c14006 (11:27): jazzrocker: in my Documents and Settings directory?",

        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:27): aye",
        "2c9e93da49d5ee0039545fd834c14006 (11:27): jazzrocker: awesome, thanks",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:28): jzxu, actually it's %HOME%\\vimfiles",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:28): jzxu, so if you set your own %HOME% then it's different",
        "2c9e93da49d5ee0039545fd834c14006 (11:28): I've never been able to successfully redefine my home directory",
        "2c9e93da49d5ee0039545fd834c14006 (11:28): it messes up everything in windows",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:29): jzxu, ummm, you don't wanna redefine My Documents, you can redefine Home no problem though",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:29): jzxu, just add HOME to your personal environment variables",

        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:38): it's all plain text, so if you're paranoid you can look through it and make sure it's not virii :)",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:39): but i can promise you it's not",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:39): you'll also want to install par",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:39): sudo apt-get install par",
        "13ee4cae35b589a84dbf772e4f25709d (11:39): wowo, someone needs to call sf and tell them i'm trying to checkout vim but its not working :)",
        "13ee4cae35b589a84dbf772e4f25709d (11:39): and hasnt been for about 5 hours.",

        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:40): nemik, :he folding",

        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:40): sf's been acting up lately for me too",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:40): nemik, those are probably two of the main features i like most and use most often",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:41): nemik, column mode is indispensable too IMO",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:41): nemik, are you using gvim?",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:41): do the files depend on vim7?",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:41): nemik, no they should work with 6.4",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:41): i tried it, but, meh. i like the cli one better",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:41): nemik, obviously you won't have the 7 features",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:42): nemik, well gvim has better colors and a number of the key bindings in my config use ALT which doesn't work in CLI mode",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:42): is 7 really needed? code completion was in 5, syntax even earlier..",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:42): ahh ok, well gvim isn't as light-weight but still MUCH better than eclipse",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:42): nemik, plus you can use diff fonts in gvim :) you'd have to change your font for terminal to do that",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:43): true",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:43): nemik, 7 has *much* more potent completion",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:43): nemik, 7 also has tabs",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:43): oohhhh, ok 7 it is",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:43): nemik, yeah perhaps not as lightweight but it launches in a blink of an eye for me and my system isn't even that fast",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:44): nemik, honestly the slightly better features of gvim *are* just that slightly much enough more better to make me use it :)",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:44): despite my horrible grammar i think you understand what i mean",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:45): oh yea, i understand. thank you for all your help on this. plus i'm kinda glad you're not as excited about emacs...that would be uncomfortable ;)",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:45): hahahah",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:45): nemik, interestingly i used to use emacs for many years before switching to vim specifically because of the lack of good PHP support in emacs",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:46): nemik, and in hindsight, simply because of the bloated obfuscated nature of the beast which is emacs itself",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:46): nemik, gvim also has drag'n'drop from Nautilus :)",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:46): exactly, everyone tells me one OS is enought",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:46): *enough",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:46): nemik, something which i know a hardcore CLI/vim fans is not apt to care about, but i find the feature to be quite nice/handy sometimes",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:47): nemik, e.g. you can drag'n'drop a file onto your currently open gvim and it will open",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:47): oh no, i would like it, use nautilus often for browsing",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:47): that sounds great",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:47): nemik, it's one of the main reasons i've not switched to KDE, apart from all the segfaults :)",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:47): haha same here",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:47): nemik, Konqeror is not fully dnd compliant",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:48): nemik, and thus you cannot drag'n'drop files from Konqeror into gvim",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:48): but interestingly you *can* drag'n'drop files from Nautilus into KDE applications... go figure",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:48): firefox is great for me, too much memory usage but incredible otherwise. the extensions are just pure awesome",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:49): nemik, heheh, yeah there seems to be a reason that most professional/production Linux apps are written using GTK+ e.g. Firefox, Thunderbird, MySQL Query Browser",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:49): i agree",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:53): nemik, did you download my config or vim7 yet?",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:53): yes, got your config and dictionaries and all that. will get vim7 later though",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:53): k, you should boot up gvim real quick",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:53): nemik, grab yourself a copy of a decent sized PHP file",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:54): nemik, open it up as a test",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:54): nemik, i'll show you some of the coolness which is my leet vim config :P",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:54): jazzrocker, got plenty of those! also do you have the tab key for autocomplete? i saw that in some config and it seems intuitive",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:55): ummm, no i prefer tab to do what it's supposed to which is insert a tab",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:55): nemik, completion works from &quot;insert&quot; mode, so i would suggest perhaps mapping CTRL-tab if it's available",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:55): nemik, custom key mappings are one of the real nice things about vim that i just take for granted",
        "ded01cf47cdca62f9adcfd25cb1b3127 (11:56): vim doesn't do custom key mappings",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:56): ciaranm, whatever man. it does exactly what i know it does, if it's not called what i said sorry for my mistake",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:56): dang pedantic hackers",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:56): hehe",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:57): nemik, got a test file open?",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:57): not bad...but did get some error",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:57): nemik, &quot;ctags not found&quot; ?",

        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:58): nemik, did you rename dotvimrc to ~/.vimrc ?",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:58): nemik, you need to do that and make sure it's readable",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:58): i did it, i'll chmod it 777 just in case then",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:59): nemik, and you're sure that .vimrc is a file?",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (11:59): no, it's a folder, with dictionaries and stuff inside...",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:59): ahhhh hehehe",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:59): nemik, .vim is the folder",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (11:59): nemik, .vimrc is the file",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (12:00): ok, let me fix that then",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (12:00): nemik, as evidenced by *what* they are on my site where you downloaded them from",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (12:00): nemik, they are named for exactly what they are",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (12:01): nemik, e.g. the one named dotvimrc is a file, and the one named dotvim.tar is a tar of my .vim/ folder",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (12:01): sorry man, i' tired. going to sleep soon after messing with this a little, but i'm liking it so far",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (12:01): hahah, np",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (12:01): nemik, got a test file open?",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (12:02): ok, now i got the ctags not found",
        "44bed523f85137332eb62fdaac74c033 (12:02): other than that it looks great",
        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (12:02): k, don't worry about that for now",

        "4ce434b52c7582ece7dc214cf37ae23b (12:02): will take care of that",
