        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (20:07): somehow, I don't think we will see too much sex, drugs, and rock and roll out of this particular standardization process. Maybe I should work on something with Anne &quot;where is the party?&quot; van Kesteren in the future :)",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:07): thinks your standardssuck videos rock!",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:08): Anne, Sicking, Hixie, Mjs, Shepazu, AnyOneElseThatWasPartOfTheWebAPIWG - what mechanism did you use to Close Issues?",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:09): 4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27, which one",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:09): the web interface?",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:09): I'm asking in general",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:09): sorry, I wasn't clear; let me start again",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:09): click &quot;edit this issue&quot; and select close in the dropdown",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:10): I'm not asking about the UI to close an Issue in the A&amp;I db",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:10): ah, you mean the protocol?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:10): like, when you decide it's closed?",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:10): I'm wondering what process WebAPI WG used to get consensus to close an Open issue",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:10): i think in many cases Anne decided",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:11): In the widgets world, we make a decision during a VoiceConf or a F2F meeting",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:11): or we have simply debated until we've reached consensus",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:11): But if there are no such meetings then I presume e-mail is used",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:11): that is as it should be, 4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:11): i think for the things debated at the F2F we reached consensus",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:11): Let me be more specific ...",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:11): after that people have raised issues and in most cases no-one has disagreed",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:11): There are some Open issues re the AC4CSR spec that I want to propose be Closed.",

        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:12): I was going to send an e-mail to public-webapps that includes a proposal to Close and a brief justification statement.",

        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:12): on the public list",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (20:13): we should talk about how this group is run at TPAC",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:13): I presume I would include something like &quot;if you disagree, please respond by YYYY-MM-DD. In the absence of any objections to my proposal on YYYY-MM-DD+1, I will Close this issue&quot;",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:14): Where YYYY-MM-DD provides 5-7 days review/response time.",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:15): Is something I propose above close to what WebAPI WG did?",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:15): 5-7 days sounds short in general, but otherwise i agree",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:15): i think we had very little formal process for closing issues",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:15): as in, it was mostly done in an ad-hoc fashion",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:16): I think it creates some confusion to leave Issues Open when they are actually Closed",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:16): agreed",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:16): having a somewhat more formal process would be a good idea",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:16): OK, so the length of the review period needs some discussion.",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:17): yeah, it also depends on how much the issue has been debated",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:17): One weeks seems reasonable to me. Someone can always re-raise an issue",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:17): before it's proposed to be closed",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (20:17): one week from open to close seems short to me, but one week between 'there seems to be some sort of agreement' to close sounds fine",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:19): Jonas, I agree 1-week between Open and Close would [almost always] be too soon",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (20:20): Initially, I am interested in closing several AC4CSR Issues that were raised several months ago.",
