        "35bb347868e2b4d20de46fcd464068ea (04:34): so i need to install x86 packages",
        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (04:37): MindDrive: u are still on this? dont get me wrong, but tape? buy harddisks, 70euros for 250gb - 120euros for 400 gb",
        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (04:37): i wonder how come the processors on the v490 are numbered 0-3 and 16-19, that seems a bit odd.",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:50): peerce: I wondered that to :)",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:50): coffman: 800G tapes ... $100. No comparison.",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:50): s/to/too",
        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (04:51): yeah sure",
        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (04:52): i do wonder how 'complete' the 2nd cores on the ultra-IV are...  sun doesn't count them as processors in their marketing literature, calling the v490 a '4-way' when its really 8-way.",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:52): $81.53 actually, is the first LTO-3 hit on google.",
        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (04:52): IBM's power5 cores are complete full performance independent CPUs",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:53): peerce: they share L3 cache, (tons of it) but they're a full CPU/core.",
        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (04:54): so I love how Sun compares a '4-way' ultra-IV to a '4-way' IBM pSeries... the 4-way IBM is two chips, 2 cores each, while the sun is 4 chips, 2 cores each.    and then sun has to find loaded sun-favorable benchmarks like Javabean stuff which they excel on",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:54): coffman: and there's no such thing as a 1000-HardDrive changer. Drives just don't scale.",
        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (04:54): and even then, the IBM is nearly as fast.",

        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (04:55): sure they dont scale, but for private use?",

        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:55): private use? Oh.. I had no idea what he was talking about. I guess I don't expect questions like that as much here (#linux, sure)",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:56): peerce: but when you have to take 1/2 your tapes off-site that's not as easy.",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:56): how much is that thing anyway? :D",
        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (04:57): $3500/TB, I think.  comes in 56TB increments (ok, and thats raw... with raiding and hotspares, its 40TB increments, 320TB per rack)",
        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (04:57): thats still a hella big tape library :D",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:57): its a virtual tape library, so I'm sure it has the option to write to tape every so often (?)",

        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (04:58): I'd personally handle offsite by having a 2nd one at another location",
        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (04:58): and MindDrive seemed to ask in that way",
        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (04:58): heh",
        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (04:59): well, backup needs a mixed solution, tape is one part of it",
        "5ca559c44d113ea4b7115a4a5563006f (04:59): but I completely agree, you can't store pr0n on tape.",
        "17352d2e1d592b2f0610db85510f8012 (05:02): coffman: Hard drives won't save me from a fire that takes out my computer.  Unless it's an external drive, which isn't quite as cheap.",
        "17352d2e1d592b2f0610db85510f8012 (05:05): An internal drive (to which I can sync) and ZFS snapshots will save me from software failures.  Mirroring will save me from simply hardware failures.  I'm currently concerned about catastrophic hardware failures.  My current data contains 10+ years of personal data that I really, really don't want to lose.",
        "17352d2e1d592b2f0610db85510f8012 (05:06): I'm sure some people can't understand such a concept for a home system, but I handle all my own email, DNS and web services, so I am the central point of failure.",
        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (05:07): at some of our costumers we use 4 sets of external hds that get changed out about 3 - 4 times a week, while only one set of them stay onsite, rest of them are stored on a safe deposit box",
        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (05:09): MindDrive: im not against tape, but sry, im against using hardware that works more or less ...",
        "bcf93319ff053842492beeb5c318b8c0 (05:09): tapes is sadly still the best long term storage //",
        "94ece629302b8d297aacee2baaf20ac0 (05:10): trede: i dont mean tape general, i mean the problem MindDrive had with the tape drive",

        "17352d2e1d592b2f0610db85510f8012 (05:11): My tape drive worked wonderfully until the CPU in my Blade 1000 decided to toast itself... sadly SCSI still isn't very affordable compared to IDE/ATA",
        "e83262f8f35492a52c92c3aa09b87546 (05:13): Heh, I found what appeared to be a USB-based SCSI adapter... $60",
        "bcf93319ff053842492beeb5c318b8c0 (05:14): did the cpu just toast itself like that ?  or was it due some other hardware failing ?",
