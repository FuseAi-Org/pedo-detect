        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:08): which is the part you mean, I think",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:08): so that's clear",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:09): but that step is done after the port is &quot;canonicalized&quot;",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:17): so the plan is for this doc to to have the definition of &quot;URL&quot; and &quot;valid URL&quot;, then algorithms for dealing with URLs, then the URL API",
