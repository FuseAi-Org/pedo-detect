        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:33): *Install",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:34): It's painful to watch",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:43): hey I have a question about blender script loading",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:43): does blender load scripts from the sub dirs of &quot;.blender\\scripts&quot; ?",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:46): cjari, probably",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:46): You could always load one manually, with the text editor, though",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:46): well I tried to install blender exporter scripts",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:47): and importer, but the importer doesnt find the scripts in the sub dir",
        "d5ee5c6d2fd12ece965ddee1686c1296 (19:48): I've been told someone here made a heart model and published it...",
        "d5ee5c6d2fd12ece965ddee1686c1296 (19:48): (just a few days ago)",
        "d5ee5c6d2fd12ece965ddee1686c1296 (19:48): anyone has the logs or knows anything more?:)",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:48): cjari, you're looking for it in the scripts menu?",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:49): Have you updated the menu?",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:49): iSteve, this's the first I've heard",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:50): Jimney, actually the menu entries are there because one script is in place in the scripts folder but the python modules (script files) that script need are in a sub dir",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:50): so the script fails saying that it cannot find the NwnMath module",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:50): Ahh",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:50): So it's making a reference to something it assumes is in the same directory",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:50): But because it's not, it fails?",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:51): yes",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:51): You could always edit the python script",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:52): hmm I have programmed in python but Im still too newbie to know how to set the import statement",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:52): there reads &quot;from NwnMath import rad2decadeg, nwn2euler&quot;",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:53): Oh",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:53): Yeah",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:53): I just realised",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:53): Everything you import has to be in the same directory, or in the system's path",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:53): Yeah",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:54): The NwnMath module need to be in $path",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:54): Or something like that.",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:54): Or in the same directory",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:54): hmm",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:54): I have DTS python scripts too and they also use sub dir for the rest of the scripts",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:55): and they seem to get them by &quot;import DTSSubDir&quot;",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:55): but Im not sure, I tried that but it didnt work for the nwn script",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:56): *-)",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:56): Where's ShortWave?",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:56): Anyone?",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:58): I'll ask in #python",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:58): thank you, I think you are right about the path thing that would be one solution",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (19:58): I think, but its not how the DTS scripts work because its not very good way",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:59): Yeah",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (19:59): Changing the path would be stupid.",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (20:01): I'm trying to figure from the DTS exporter install scripts how is it setup",

        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (20:13): thank you jimmey but i dont get that script, looks like linux thing",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (20:14): but i created __init__.py and at least you now import the module it self",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (20:15): *you can",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (20:19): cjari, it is",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (20:19): cjari, I was just showing you what #python was yielding",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (20:21): I know",
        "203a66a9a3b53863a5b821bbc1a63539 (20:22): wow I got the import thing solved but now it looks like this version of blender has problems with this script",

        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (20:23): Yafray doesn't work nicely, if at all, and none of the scripts seem to",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (20:24): I'm waiting until the Ubuntu people have the newest Blender release in the repos.",
