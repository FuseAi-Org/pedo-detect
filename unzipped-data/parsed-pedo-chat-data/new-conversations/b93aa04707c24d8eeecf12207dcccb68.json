        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:13): wonders why we can't just say they're aliases for each other",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:14): Like &lt;i&gt; and &lt;em&gt;, and &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:15): No, those actually have useful differences (even though they may be non-existent in practice)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:15): I don't think his points are addressed by making &lt;abbr&gt; and &lt;acronym&gt; act the same way",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:15): If the differences are non-existent, doesn't that mean that actually they don't have useful differences?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:15): differences but non-existent. hmm.. :-)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:16): 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: In a far future, the practice may have changed :)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (20:16): spec vs impl. hmm... :)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:16): But we're never, ever going to get agreement on the whole abbreviation nightmare",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:17): Perhaps the important requirement is that a conscientious author should be able to easily work out which element to use in a given situation",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:17): (because otherwise they'll waste time arguing about which is best, since they're too conscientious to just pick one arbitrarily)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:18): But it's equally important that the consumer of the information agrees the element is correct",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:21): Consumers will treat the different elements identically, because most authors are not conscientious and will pick one arbitrarily, and consumers can't detect how hard the author thought before deciding on an element, so they can't treat the elements differently",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:22): 3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2: True",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:22): so consumers don't care, and most authors don't care, so all we can do is make life a little easier for the authors who do care",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:23): (e.g. by keeping them out of arguments over whether SQL is an &lt;acronym&gt; or an &lt;abbr&gt;)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:29): It depends if it is part of MySQL or note :P",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:30): Or SQLite",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:31): I can imagine that way back when someone started to split hairs about acronyms and abbreviations and someone else thought it would be easier to give in and have both than to deal with the complaints",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (20:31): and since then countless of hours have been wasted debating correct usage",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:31): I thought it was a netscape vs IE thing",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:32): deduced part of the pronunciation from the official parts of the SQLite site saying &quot;an SQLite database&quot; and not &quot;a SQLite database&quot;",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:32): Peh. Netscape is dead.",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:32): (but the non-official parts (like the bug tracker) seemed to have a roughly equal mix of 'a' vs 'an')",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:32): an SQLite database?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:32): how does that work out?",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:33): &quot;an Ess Queue Light database&quot;, I think",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:33): ess kju",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (20:33): Ess. If you phonetically spell it, it makes sense :)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (20:34): A/an is founded on pronounciation, after all",

        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:34): (See http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q7 etc)",

        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:35): Incidentally, I think &quot;an historic&quot; is silly, unless you pronounce it like &quot;an 'istoric&quot;",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (20:36): and I don't think the Queen's English includes &quot;'istoric&quot;",
