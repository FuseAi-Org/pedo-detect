        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (02:55): heh",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (02:55): (we were confused before since we were looking at Content-Range, the response header, rather than the request header)",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (02:58): gonna stick with gzipped (simple index + concatinated data) for now though... well, for my games, that is",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (02:59): do you happen to know how to make xhr get cachable with opera?",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (02:59): don't know any workaround for that",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (02:59): far future expires headers do nothing",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (02:59): well... i could just stick all of that into local storage, but that looks kinda silly",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:00): you shouldn't have to reimplement http caching with web storage, heh",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:00): also with a few games on one site that 5mb limit will be broken easily",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:01): i probably should just ignore it for now",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:01): i think some mobile versions of google sites, like images.google, cache javascript in localStorage",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:01): pretty... gross, heh",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:01): it works in any other browser and opera's market share is kinda small",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:01): yea they pump js, css, and whatever into local storage in order to bypass awkward limitations of mobile browsers",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:02): eg the iphone won't cache anything &gt;25kb",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:02): (or &gt;15kb... depends on the version of the os)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:02): that's another strangeness--if you're on a cell connection caching is even more important than usual, so it's strange that they don't cache as aggressively as available storage allows",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:03): well, i can imagine why they did that",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:03): on early generation phones which had more limited storage, okay",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:03): latency is very high... so they rather try to cache as many of those tiny files as possible",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:03): i don't know how much caching androidbrowser does, either",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:03): personally, i think they should have differenciated between images and js though",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:06): ah found it on reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/guj5m/the_mobile_version_of_bing_uses_localstorage_to",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:07): also this thing: http://www.phpied.com/iphone-caching/",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:07): mobile browsers are disgusting :)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:08): it's pretty fundamentally nonsensical to stop caching based on size--it means that optimizing loads by combining scripts into one file can lead to it not being cached",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:10): yea",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:10): or sprites... or merged css files",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:10): (spritesheets) :&gt;",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:11): speaking of optimizations, i'm really looking forward to webp with alpha",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:11): finally we will have some kind of lossy rgba image format on the web",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:11): i'm pretty badly unimpressed with webp",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:11): (i still wish mozilla hadn't killed jng back then...)",

        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:12): it's somewhat smaller at usual quality and quit a lot smaller at somewhat acceptable quality",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:12): well, the key point for me is lossy+alpha",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:12): it's aggrevating that with google in a position to push a newer image format, they're pushing a half-baked, narrow-focus one that isn't actually a general replacement for jpeg",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:13): that's the only raison d'?\u2122tre it needs",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:13): afaict it's at least as good as jpg",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:14): i remember off-hand that it has smaller resolution limitations; recall there being some other limitations but don't recall them off-hand",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:15): 16383x16383",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:16): big enough for the web",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:16): jpg is probably 64k x 64k",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:16): (like png)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:16): see, that's a narrow-minded focus, which is very different from the mindset of making a *general-purpose* image format",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:16): yep",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:17): i don't want to see an &quot;image format for the web&quot;; i want to see a general-purpose lossy image format, with one major use being the web",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:17): lots of png loaders break apart at 32k though :&gt;",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:18): 16k is enough for most things though",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:18): web, games, photos...",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:18): but it's smaller than jpeg, which means there are uses which jpeg handles and webp does not, which means jpeg isn't completely obsoleted",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:19): print (up to A4, i guess)",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:19): true",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:19): i don't want to see &quot;use the new format, unless you need to do this list of uncommon but valid things:&quot;",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:20): well, you won't need to tell that anyone. webp simply won't be available as option if the dimensions are too big",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:21): or if the bitdepth is too high",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:21): and now they have to worry about the differences between the formats, instead of forgetting about the obsolete format; and they'll have to do this effectively forever",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:22): which is the main problem--if webp gains traction we'll probably not see a new generation of lossy still image compression for 20+ years",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:22): well, we can use jp2 in about 10 years :&gt;",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:22): (jpeg2000)",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:24): either way, this is my primary concern: http://kaioa.com/b/1011/jng_decision_matrix.svgz",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:24): thing is, people do it anyways and the pages get *amazingly* fat",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:25): i wonder how it handles alpha-channel artifacting; if artifacts cause pixels to become partially opaque where they were originally fully transparent, it effectively displays undefined pixels in the color channels",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:26): yes, but that doesn't really matter",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:27): there are wrong colors, but the opacity will be very low",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:27): it matters if you jack the compression level up high enough to create nontrivial artifacts",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:27): http://kaioa.com/b/1102/svgjng/index.html &lt;- take a look (with opera)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:27): which is less of a problem with better compression, but it's always possible",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:28): i guess it'd probably not look any more wrong than the other rgb compression artifacts that would also happen",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:29): webp will most likely support two modes for alpha: lossy and lossless (similar to jng)",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:30): the quality of the alpha channel can be changed independently",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:30): so, you do have some control how broken the result will look",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:34): also, i assume webp doesn't address animations and sprites; animations aren't so important but they're logically identical to sprites, which are",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:35): foo.webp#bar foo.webp#baz etc would be cool",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:36): well... probably the wrong place ;)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (03:36): well, less concerned about how it's exposed at the higher level as there being support for it within the file format--if it's supported by the format then web APIs using it will follow, if it's finalized and deployed without it, well...",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:38): feel free to discuss that with the people over at #vp8",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:38): skal is the dude who's working on alpha, by the way",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:39): i for one don't really know if having multiple &quot;pages&quot; makes much sense with that format",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:46): on a somewhat related note, i wonder if i should write some canvas based jpg+jpg or jpg+png splicing thing, which uses localStorage to store the result",
        "cc7bcfbc58c467939c5987584fc882cb (03:46): would be fun, i guess",
