        "13d7d168f19c177db483c695588e476c (10:19): one reason for gg being better might be that you have to reach up to type numbers and then back down to shift for G",
        "13d7d168f19c177db483c695588e476c (10:20): or otherwise twist up your hand with your pinky at the ready",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:21): yeah it starts with gg over 1G",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:21): then you discover 2gg",
        "13d7d168f19c177db483c695588e476c (10:23): I'm wondering, why bother have space, backspace, and enter in normal mode when you have hjkl?",

        "8bece2647a39db763401c1e98abe5854 (10:24): praetis: I don't even have up/down/left/right in normal mode. they're bound to things like next buffer previous buffer.",

        "8bece2647a39db763401c1e98abe5854 (10:24): space being zj and backspace being zk would be fun",

        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:25): praetis, mainly because space is too easy to hit by accident",

        "13d7d168f19c177db483c695588e476c (10:32): now this is interesting, why's Ctrl-J also move down? Five different commands for that?",
