        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (00:47): that looks sane to me",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:47): (I know the end tags are a bit wacky, but being nice with them would result in even crazier code than that needs)",

        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:15): well, actually I guess one could use it when generating a citation",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:51): Hmm, apparently IE treats unknown tags as empty because if it parsed them as containers then IE3 ran out of stack space on some common bogus content",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (01:59): so it's &lt;?xml:namespace ...&gt;",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:06): IE actually handles both &lt;?xml:namespace /&gt; and &lt;xml:namespace /&gt; in exactly the same way, by adding the &lt;?xml:... /&gt; one to the DOM, which is visible by looking at the .innerHTML of the document",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:11): Does it actually add it to the DOM, or does the innerHTML getter synthesise it for output?",
