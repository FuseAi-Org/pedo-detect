        "de76c8e6cbbc3c1c44788a340cac141e (08:37): I have a script like that - it's nice in addition to port knocking",
        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (08:37): its good except if apache crashes",
        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (08:37): unless we could make a secret open port",
        "58d3a409fd84ac187b92ac3e8f031f37 (08:38): or you could just use the limit setting of iptables and drop the connetions after the limit is reached",

        "5f05b3ded4139f6a691da91429a957b9 (08:50): I like the apache idea though; an interesting take (but a bit overkill for my needs)",
        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (08:53): i think is the best solution  even  if someone uses a snifer  he cant pass the ssh password and you get logs",
        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (08:53): the only problem i see is if apache crashes",

        "58d3a409fd84ac187b92ac3e8f031f37 (09:07): nice might have to give that one a whirl",
        "5f05b3ded4139f6a691da91429a957b9 (09:08): It *may* requie 2.6.17.x and iptables 1.3.5, as that's what I'm running, but I'm almost certain it doesn't",
        "5f05b3ded4139f6a691da91429a957b9 (09:08): I've also got that config running on a 2.4.x server (unknown iptable version)",
        "58d3a409fd84ac187b92ac3e8f031f37 (09:09): thnx will give it a try.",

        "5f05b3ded4139f6a691da91429a957b9 (09:11): There's nothing really in what I wrote that you can't get yourself from the iptables man page and Stephen's site",

        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (09:17): you can use webmin",
        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (09:17): but is better to be made by hand",
        "d5c13a449d4434ff4799de4a1e0560d9 (09:17): Well I normally wouldn't consider it myself, however this professor is a windoze guy, and will have a tough time with bash once I'm gone.",
        "5f05b3ded4139f6a691da91429a957b9 (09:17): Maybe I'm just weird, but I can't imagine how a gui would *help* anything",
        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (09:18): it sure helps if you dont understand the  iptables",
        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (09:19): and its more powerfull with no gui",

        "d770d01baf68068d340c8ab95d251419 (09:19): wait a minut",
        "d5c13a449d4434ff4799de4a1e0560d9 (09:20): I've only heard rumors that their are some out their that make the configuration process easier in some way...",
        "de76c8e6cbbc3c1c44788a340cac141e (09:20): usually they also limit what can be done with iptables in order to make it simpler",
        "d5c13a449d4434ff4799de4a1e0560d9 (09:22): Well I'm no guru for certain, but I don't think he needs anything too complex, so I'm hoping if changes need to be made after I'm gone, I will be able to either comment well enough or leave him with a gui that might simplify any small changes that need to be made.",
