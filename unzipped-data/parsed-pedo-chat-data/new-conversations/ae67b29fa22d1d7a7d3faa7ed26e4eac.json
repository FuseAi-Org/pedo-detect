        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:13): ponders about DanC's request for everyone to put disclaimers on most things they say",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:15): it's just for public-html-comments",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:15): and might not count for editors",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:16): rejoices",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (00:17): wants HTML mail just so he can use 20em disclaimers, in red.",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:17): oh, i thought it was intended for public-html.",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:19): no",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:20): wonders if he should retroactively disclaim things he said earlier",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:21): if you do, mention my name as well :)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:22): Well I was thinking I would have to email the list again, but that seems antisocially noisy, so maybe private email to the original posters",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:26): I think the disclaimers is a bad idea",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (00:27): everyone's comments should just be considered to be personal opinion, unless it explicitly states it's on behalf of the working group",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:27): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: they seem unnecessary to me too, and very hard to write well",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:27): i guess a boilerplate to include anytime we send to -comments seems easiest",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:28): For example saying &quot;I think foo but that doesn't represent the opinion of the WG&quot; suggests the WG thinks &quot;not foo&quot;",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:28): with probably just a link to DanC's email requesting disclaimers",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:28): what does it mean for a working group to have an opinion anyway?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:28): especially one with 500+ people",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:29): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: It seems to mean that we have taken a formal vote on something",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:29): You can say &quot;The working group has decided X&quot; (or, if there is an assumption that you are speaking on behalf of the working group, just say &quot;X&quot;), and that doesn't involve opinions",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:30): prefers the whatwg style",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:30): where everyone just has their own opinions",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:30): and there's no attempt at pretending that everyone agrees on everything (or anything)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:32): Acid3 test 76 (unwritten) is interesting",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (00:33): http://google.com/search?q=cache:kqZmhh_nOjEJ:hixie.ch/tests/evil/acid/003/NOT_READY_PLEASE_DO_NOT_USE.html - I guess that's an unsupported way of running the test",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:33): it's certainly not a way that's going to be very useful",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:34): having a quirks mode acid test isn't such a bad idea",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:35): if there was a spec...",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:36): yep, writing it is on my to-do list ;)",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:37): thanks to Acid2 there's at least one additional quirk in the HTML parser :-(",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:37): i know the feeling",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:37): oh?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:37): &lt;p&gt;&lt;table&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:37): that's been a quirk for years, in compliant browsers like mozilla",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:37): so was lack of sgml comment parsing",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:38): yeah well that's a different case",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:38): neh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:38): &lt;p&gt;&lt;table/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; is dumb, at least given our model in html5",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:38): i don't regret forcing that issue at all",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:39): i agree that standards mode parsing of &lt;p&gt;&lt;table&gt; makes more sense, but i'd rather it worked the same in both quirks and no-quirks",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:39): granted, i don't know how many pages would break if we did standards mode parsing of &lt;p&gt;&lt;table&gt; in quirks mode too",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (00:41): enough for it to matter last i checked",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:41): how did you check?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:42): the knowledge that pages contain &lt;p&gt;&lt;table&gt; doesn't mean that those will necessarily break when parsing as standards mode",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (00:43): i mean, if there's no matching css and scripts doesn't depend on it, and the trailing &lt;/p&gt; after the table creates an empty P, then it will probably be rendered the same"
