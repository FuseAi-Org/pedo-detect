        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:47): I'm building qtopia-core-4.1.4 for ARM.  Can someone explain why the q_atomic stuff from i386 is getting included in my applications?  (With the expected results)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:48): Because of how you configured it? ;)",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:49): ya think?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:49): Here's my thought...",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:50): Your problem was that it built qmake wrong.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:50): Copy the qmake binary that you're currently using, move it out of the way, and make confclean",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:50): Configure it for ARM with the -fast option so it doesn't actually try running qmake during configure",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:50): Move qmake back into place and make sub-src",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:51): Sounds like it at least has potential.",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:52): you mean &quot;make distclean&quot; instead of &quot;confclean&quot;?  That target isn't in my Makefiles",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:52): Hmm? At least on Linux, configure ends with a note saying &quot;make confclean to reconfigure&quot;",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:52): ... or are you talking about reconfiguring Qtopia?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:52): Yeah",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:52): aah.",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:52): shit, I was afraid you were going to say that.  :)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:52): ^^()",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (01:53): Well, I suppose before that you should ensure you're using the right makespec",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:53): well, the Qtopia libs are all ARM (I checked), and the Makefile qmake is producing for my project calls out for arm-linux-g++...",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:54): which makes me think I've got the right makespec.",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:55): I didn't have this problem with 4.1.1...",
        "56029d361cadef136ba8c507a7446027 (01:55): at any rate, it'll have to sit for a while; I've got other fires burning.  now that i know what the problem is, I figure I can just ignore it for a bit.",

        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (01:57): noone has seen these link errors when moving from 4.1 to 4.2?",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (01:58): nope",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (01:58): craziness.. I don't understand how it could be the case, it built all the examples/demos with no problem",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (01:58): but as I said, I've only tried the non-snapshot preview and I didn't upgrade by rsync, I just used used a fresh tarball FWIW",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (01:58): oh no, this is with 4.2tp",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (01:59): I couldn't get the snapshot to build",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (02:01): have you tried compiling from the tarball instead? Shouldn't matter, but who knows.",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (02:02): well I mean the tarbal for the tp on their site should build my app fine right? have you had any problems so far? or have you &quot;ported&quot; anything from 4.1 to 4.2?",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (02:02): I noticed a few problems, but nothing you've encountered yet",
        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (02:03): but I guess you've compiled the 4.2TP now, but it won't compile your app..",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (02:04): right",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (02:04): well it compiles it fine, just runs into massive amounts of link errors relating to QString::fromAscii_helper",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (02:05): oi and for some reason on my 4th make distclean, it just compiled..",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (02:06): jesus",

        "d29d567972e1e13b8bd390e5395b685d (02:07): wonder if they're going to update the tasktracker for 4.2 anytime soon.. I know there's the mailing list, but still",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (02:07): well then again I commented out CONFIG+=release x86 ppc, perhaps there's something about that",
        "c52078b64f237bfc9c7d45993c0bdab7 (02:09): yeah seems to have to do with release config..",
