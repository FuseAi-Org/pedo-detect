        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:15): Am I the only one who thinks that the existence of Ctrl+scroll wheel in browsers probably causes many more users to find websites mysteriously the wrong size than it actually helps anyone?",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:15): you are not",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:22): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762, it helps me",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:22): Well, it probably doesn't *hurt* anyone in this channel, because we all know the magic Ctrl+0 trick.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:23): But I constantly see people asking how to reset their browser to the right zoom level.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:23): I use zoom shortcuts too, but would it really hurt to have them less accessible?  Like Ctrl-Shift-mouse wheel or something?",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:24): this is why Opera disables single key shortcuts by defaults - they are too easy to hit by accident",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:24): its easy to be using ctrl for something and hit the scroll wheel by accident",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:27): Oh, it does that for all single-key shortcuts?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:27): I recall it requires Shift-Esc or something for accesskeys, which always struck me as inconvenient.",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:27): theres an option that simply re-enables single key shortcuts, like z for back and x for forward",
        "40cddb5ac261f4694179715cd8424278 (20:33): I remember when Opera had a single-key shortcut for turning images on and off, it was bloody annoying :)",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:34): Oh, so we were talking about double-key shortcuts, not single-key.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:34): Backspace is an annoying shortcut.",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:35): I find it more annoying that my firefox doesn't have that shortcut",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:35): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 - strongly agreed, backspace is a very annoying shortcut.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:35): really wish I could disable that",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:36): have lost content too many times due to that shortcut",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:36): I've used backspace on a laptop before, when I didn't have a mouse with back/forward buttons.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:36): The back button on my current mouse hasn't worked for a long time, though, and I mostly just click the back button when I want to go back.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:36): should look into that.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:36): e.g. you think you're focused in a text field, and want to delete characters you just typed, but it turns out the &quot;document&quot; has focus, and then backspace/delete goes back, and loses your textarea edits.",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:37): your browser doesn't remember the field contents?",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:37): wishes he could patch is browsers to *not* treat backspace/delete as &quot;go back&quot; in navigation.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:38): Steve^ depends on if the page was the result of a form submit etc.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:38): then if you try to go forward, you get asked, do you want to resubmit? etc.",

        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:38): or worse, AJAX hacks to edit content that don't recover from back/forward",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:39): Anyway, one of my first MediaWiki commits was removing an annoying shortcut.  https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8203",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:40): apart from the AJAX wizardry, your browser doesn't account for form submit pages?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:40): f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905, well, if you use an open-source browser, you can!",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:41): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 - not without lots of work recompiling and merging with updates.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:41): Probably wouldn't have to do much work merging with updates, just recompiling.  It's unlikely those lines would get changed often.  But, yeah, just saying.",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:41): Maybe I'll just point out that Opera has none of these problems, without you patching the browser?",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:42): might be simpler in the short-term",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:42): seems to me like shortcuts should be in a separate config file anyway",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:42): Yeah, every game out there lets you change all your shortcuts -- why not browsers too?",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:42): I'd be fine even with a &quot;defaults write com.apple.webkit ... &quot; type solution (for webkit, firefox etc.)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:42): Opera has a handy keyboard shortcut editing dialog so you can disable backspace there if you want",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:43): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c - nice - thanks I'll check that out.",

        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:43): So, &lt;video&gt; replaces flash on the ipad. What's going to replace PDFs?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:44): Who wants to replace PDFs?",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:44): i.e, when are we going to able to print properly from the net?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:44): PDF is a standard format, why do you need to replace it?",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:44): doesn't work on my phone",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:44): Just use a different implementation if you don't like Adobe's.",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:45): if its a matter of time for it to get to all devices, then that's probably ok",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:45): I assumed it was more of a royalty deal",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:45): or implementation problem",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:45): PDF can be implemented royalty-free.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:45): And is.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:45): There's already lots of reader and writer implementations",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:45): Tons of programs support it.",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:45): does Android have one?",
        "40cddb5ac261f4694179715cd8424278 (20:45): My phone has a pdf reader installed by default.",
        "40cddb5ac261f4694179715cd8424278 (20:46): I've never used it though :p",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (20:46): thought HTML+CSS was supposed to replace the need for PDF. ;)",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:47): f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905, that's what you'd expect, but you can't print from the web - I can't do my CV in HTML",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (20:47): Steve^, why not?",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (20:47): it's ideal in that you can format exactly how you want and yet the browsers let you down",
