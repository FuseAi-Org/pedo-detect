        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:32): it seems that some canvas UI developers don't regard being able to manipulate an accessibility API directly as anything like the same as having to build a DOM",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:33): The guys behind Cappuchino took a close look at ARIA, and largely rejected it on the basis that it requires DOM manipulation.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:33): right",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:34): If there's a role for bolt-ons of this sort, it's likely to back widget systems like Cappuchino.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:34): turning &lt;canvas&gt; into a DOM-based model would not make them happy",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:34): I thought Rich was talking about an accessibility API model rather than a DOM model.",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:34): which seems to match what the Cappuchino guys were asking for",

        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:35): is the post I'm thinking of.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:35): thanks",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:35): Rich was talking about an object model as well as an accessibility API as far as I can tell",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:35): okay",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:36): but yeah, maybe we do need an API",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:36): I'm not sure of the practical differences between a DOM and accessibility API manipulation (I've not done any desktop GUI programming).",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:36): I just don't think we should rush into it",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:36): I don't want another ARIA",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (18:38): 3dc0456e027e36cfd9e180b0fb4e5f32: Irony, idioms, implications, etc remain in any language",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:38): ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee, btw, &quot;As far as Cappuccino implementation is concerned, there is enough in ARIA that we can significantly enhance the accessibility of Cappuccino, if not 100%.&quot;",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:38): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: I think that reflects the fact that Cappuchino isn't entirely Canvas.",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:39): there's a lot of divitis and spanitis &quot;controls&quot; in there too.",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:39): so there's already DOM hooks for some things",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:39): as I said in my latest email, entirely &lt;canvas&gt; is not what &lt;canvas&gt; is meant for",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:39): Sure.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:39): it's an indication of other deeper flaws that need fixing",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:40): and his example of SVG is bogus afaict, since SVG does have a DOM",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:40): so that leaves Bespin",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:40): yep",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (18:40): i doubt Bespin will be the last tho.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:42): I'll counter with premature optimization",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:44): ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee, you have a point though and I hope you keeping dropping by to make them ;) (don't want to be entirely dismissive)",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:56): ffs, Pirate Bay is to be banned in the Netherlands",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:02): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: So what? It's going to die as soon as the sale goes through anyhow.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (19:02): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e, not to worry, if it gets sold, TPB will be dead in a month anyway",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:04): it's the principle",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:04): also, the main guy in charge of the sale apparently quit and there's some rumor over lack of sufficient money",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:04): in any case, I don't like it that this is possible at all",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:26): wonders if Leif realizes that &lt;/ no longer needs to be escaped because we removed SGML cruft, not because we kept it around...",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:28): then again, he compares JavaScript and PHP as if they are the same and does not see the logic in treating one as a first-class Web citizen and the other as yet another server-side templating language...",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:36): I have problems taking the proposal seriously myself",
