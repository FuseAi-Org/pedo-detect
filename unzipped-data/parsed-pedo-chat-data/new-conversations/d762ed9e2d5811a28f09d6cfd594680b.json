        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:24): i was just wondering how u guys implemented change management? i mean assuming there are 2 or more sysadmins .. how do u guys go about documenting the fact that you changed this file's contents this line form a 0 to a 1 for example; so that the other sysadmin(s) know about these changes. thanks",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:26): after the action we update /modifications file, after the login you`ll last 10 rows from this file",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:26): see*",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:27): dd/mm/yy name action",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:27): the problem is you can forget :)",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:36): Coques: true",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:36): Coques:  i was thinking more along the lines of a wiki ..",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:37): thing is in a stable environment changes are very rare .. and so by human nature ppl get lazy to look at the wiki .. or update the wiki",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:38): sure",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:39): have u tried script ?",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:40): e.g. if you use /modifications file you could make an alias for &quot;exit&quot; command which forces you to update this file :)",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:41): as in a redirect to vi /var/log/system-modifications file :) ..nice .. ... hmm",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:42): maybe not for minor actions but if you filter such command as ls,*display it could only force you to update it when you run more destructive commands",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:43): i was thinking more along the lines of the program called script .. put in a shell script and use that shell script as the login program instead of /usr/bin/ksh .. whatcha think?",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:43): ok, you launched vgexport? yes, update the file! :)",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:43): yes, something like this",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:43): i`m thinkig to do the same on my servers",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:43): oh .. u mean per program ? thats a lot of work ;)",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:44): no no :)",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:44): just filter list commands",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:45): no i mean this: script               (1)  - make typescript of terminal session",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:45): its a program thats available",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:46): oh .. u mean type exit .. which is actually not a command any more .. and it will grep .sh_history for a regexp .. if it hits something important then .. ask to update the modifications file?",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:46): yes, something similar :))",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:46): but what about vi .. there will be a lot of &quot;false positives&quot; with that",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:47): yeah..",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:47): and vi is used quite a lot .. some of the sysadmins use it to view files instead of cat|pg|more",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:47): teach your admins!",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:47): vi &lt;&gt; view",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:48): Coques: i m the newest and not the most senior ;)",

        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:48): which is why script",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:48): no user interaction necessary",
        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (13:50): but it doesnt capture vi changes .. tho i will know it was opened ..hmm.. need some thought",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:50): i don`t know better tracking",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:51): but forge for wiki, nobody will open one window more",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (13:51): forget*",

        "a9ef142262d2f62a0c21ec53e7407046 (14:00): i made a cvs server on NT (coz they wanted it) for the devleopers and installed the tools on thier machines and everything was set up for them including permissions and domain and they dint use it .. the extra step of committing was too much for them.. the server was eventually formatted a month later",
