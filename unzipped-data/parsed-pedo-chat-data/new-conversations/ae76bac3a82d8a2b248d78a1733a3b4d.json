        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:06): Parsing maybe?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:10): It would fit with his earlier article suggesting there is something magical in the transition between undefined parsing and defined parsing that means we are suddenly trying to create a &quot;Networked-Object-Model&quot;",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:11): (or something, I think we concluded at the time that that bit of the earlier article made no sense)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:12): I'm not sure what the bottom line of his new article is",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:12): interesting ideas, I'm not sure I can fully agree with a native app being a Web app",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:12): I think to be considered a Web app, you have to not just use URIs but be URI addressable",
        "fd9ef1223e855714294498ebfde79f98 (00:13): which was ben's point",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:13): Indeed.",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:15): I suppose the cynical interpretation is &quot;I'm supposed to be promoting android now  so I have to say that native apps are good and not anti-web&quot;. But I have no real reason to believe that the cynical reason is the corect one",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:15): Ben's point was stronger - not only does your app need to be URI-addressable, but at least some places inside it should be URI-addressable",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:15): which would exclude most Flash on the Web",
        "b5934067b4c7d9c30299478a245d4491 (00:16): a web app should be in the web, not merely on the web?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:16): that was Ben Ward's argument",
        "b5934067b4c7d9c30299478a245d4491 (00:16): it's also the classic argument for RDF :)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:16): Tim's position seems to be that a web app doesn't even have to be on the Web, it just needs to link to the web",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:17): Arguably he is allow allowing for the possibility of creating or modifying resources",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:18): But yeah, I wouldn't consider something that can read or modify the web to necessarily be a part of the web",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (00:18): &quot;A large proportion of the native applications on iPhone, and on Android, and on Windows, and on Mac, and on Linux, are Web applications. They depend in a fundamental way on being able to recognize and make intelligent use of hyperlinks and traverse the great big wonderful Web.&quot;",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (00:18): I think Tim's reasoning would make a Web browser a Web app",
