        "2513534ba428b7cb32acad9319515548 (09:52): this is about the 3rd time its entirely hung on a different computer",

        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:16): I don't think it was the prog, I think it was the fact that nobody was seeding for a while",
        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:17): I asked about this earlier, and got lost trying to implement every solution or suggestion received",

        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:19): could be how you partitioned it",
        "2513534ba428b7cb32acad9319515548 (10:19): espresso: the drive is from another system, has win 2k3 on it trying to format it",

        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:20): I don't think so... could be something in your CMOS",
        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:20): typically, when I have hard drive issues like that, I usually check my cmos first",

        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:23): when you reboot your system, watch your splash screen to see something like 'Press the [whatever] key to enter setup'",
        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:23): [whatever] is usually Delete or F1 key",
        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:24): if you hit that key just as your computer is powering on (before the OS loads), it should take you into the CMOS settings",
        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:24): then you can see how your computer is recognizing the new hard drive",

        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:26): T3hWiz0rd: depending on your mobo, you'll most likely want one master and one slave, and not want to do cs",
        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:26): are you using IDE or SATA?",
        "2513534ba428b7cb32acad9319515548 (10:27): espresso: it seems to vary on what power connector i use too",

        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:30): then don't do master, unless that's what the drive label says to do",
        "7667c57ea1ae1645feed5f76175e3c62 (10:30): then when you boot, try to get into CMOS",

        "2513534ba428b7cb32acad9319515548 (10:37): assuming, for the sake of argument, I can ever make it work.",
        "2513534ba428b7cb32acad9319515548 (10:37): espresso: what seems to be playing a factor is which power connector i use on it.",
