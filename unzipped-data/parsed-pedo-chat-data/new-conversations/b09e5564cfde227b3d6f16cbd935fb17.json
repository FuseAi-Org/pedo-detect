        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (16:43): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: They are usually made up by untrained armadillos",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:43): I didn't want to have to wait nearly 3 weeks :-(",
        "e2633ed61085592add6e058692dfff2f (16:43): their estimates for delivery to NZ are often pretty bad",
        "e2633ed61085592add6e058692dfff2f (16:43): they'll say 3 weeks and I get it in 8 days",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:43): ok",
        "e2633ed61085592add6e058692dfff2f (16:43): so 'bad' in a good way",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (16:43): Or the opposite",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (16:44): I have had &quot;it will be (small number of days) and it was actually (large number of days)&quot;",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (16:44): er, the second &quot; was in quite the wrong place there",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (16:48): hey, can someone point me in the right direction, i have some lines rendered on canvas",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (16:48): and i want to be able to measure them",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (16:48): with the mouse ;",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (16:48): just wondered if anyonecould point me at some recommened reading&gt;?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:52): d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80, in what unit do you want to measure them? Number of pixels? length in mm as rendered on the screen? Other?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:53): in any case, I think the basic concept of doing that is to find the position of line's end points, and then use a bit of trig to calculate the length",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:56): or, actually, a^2 = b^2 + c^2 should be enough to calculate the length, where b and c are abs(x1-x2) and abs(y1-y2)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:57): (You don't need abs)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:58): yeah, I realised that after I wrote it cause they're squared. But whatever",
        "b91adcb9dadbcdd2609eef5ff978162c (16:58): If I use HTML5 can I use &lt;script&gt; tags or will I still need to include the text/javascript for the time being?",
        "b91adcb9dadbcdd2609eef5ff978162c (16:58): looking to support IE7 on up",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:59): b91adcb9dadbcdd2609eef5ff978162c: You mean writing &lt;script&gt; instead of &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;?",
        "b91adcb9dadbcdd2609eef5ff978162c (16:59): correct",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:59): That works and has always worked and will always work",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:59): so there's no compatibility problem",
        "b91adcb9dadbcdd2609eef5ff978162c (16:59): ah ok cool, but wasn't it invalid with html4?",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (16:59): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 pixles",
        "b91adcb9dadbcdd2609eef5ff978162c (16:59): ok awesome, thanks",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:59): b91adcb9dadbcdd2609eef5ff978162c: It may have been",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:00): b91adcb9dadbcdd2609eef5ff978162c: but that's independent of what browsers support (and have to support, since lots of people already write &lt;script&gt;)",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:00): with xy coords of the mouse?",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:00): any way to lock on corners/endpoints?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:00): do you mean, when the user clicks a point on the canvas, how do you get those co-ordinates?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:01): or do you want to snap to the nearest end-point of an existing line?",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:01): well mouse XY will do i suppose, but it would be great ifi could snap to existing endpoints",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:02): do you have a collection with all the line end point co-ordinates, that you can search through?",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:03): a collection?",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:03): errm",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:04): well i guess i could make one",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:04): like stick all the endpoints in an array or something",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:04): yeah",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:05): so then when you capture the mouse event, you get the x,y coords from that event object, adjusting for the element's position (can't remember the exact code for this off hand)",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:06): ok that doesnt sound too hard",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:06): then when you have those coords, you have to search through the array to find the nearest point.",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:06): heh CAD in browser",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:06): that requires some math that I'm not personally familiar with, but you should be able to find it through a web search",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:06): im pretty good with the maths",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:07): but the code escapes me sometimes!",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:07): it's probably something simple like finding the lowest values of (mouseX - pointX) and (mouseY - pointY), for each point",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (17:07): It's just the same maths as before",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:07): oh, yeah, find the shortest hypotenuse will do it",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:07): well I wouldnt have thourght of storing all of the end points, so thats good",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:08): this way, i can scale the canvas down, and the measuring will still work",
        "d7304e43ecdabb4efa0636d51408ca80 (17:11): thanks alot guys"
