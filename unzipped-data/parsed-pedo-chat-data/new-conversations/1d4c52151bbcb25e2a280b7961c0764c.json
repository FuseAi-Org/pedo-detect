        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (02:44): hey all, I'm having trouble with QGraphicsItem etc. in Qt 4.2",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (02:45): In essence QGraphicsItem::scenePos() always seems to return 0,0",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:01): does anyone else have any experience with this?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:01): I haven't touched 4.2 yet, myself",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:02): It's really nice and this is the first problem I've had",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:02): I tried tracing it through the Qt source code but it's all hidden by their macros",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:02): so I'm kinda baffles",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:02): *baffled",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:03): Macros?",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:06): like all the #defines in qglobal.h",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:06): it makes it too complex for me to track exactly whats happening in their code :S",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:26): It's ridiculous. I add an item to the scene at a certain point and immediately request it's scenePos and it's 0,0 regardless of where I put it in the first place",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (03:26): Strange.",
        "60dc5715516d1eb933eca1fbd1bb3df3 (03:28): I don't even know if it's a bug or if I'm simply using it wrong :s",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (03:44): im using cleartype on my CRT, and it makes me feel lika bad boy, BAD",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (03:45): looks better than i expected",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:03): how &quot;easy&quot;/&quot;hard&quot; is it to port qt to a different os",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:03): ?",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:06): i can imagine it involves quite some work.  what os would you want to port it to, out of curiosity",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:06): i dont want to port it",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:06): some guy in the forums says that he &quot;will do that quite fast&quot; and so on",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:08): i guess there is no good answer to that question, besides what does &quot;fast&quot; mean anyway",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:09): he just says &quot;beside &lt;something&gt; i will port it (like out of being bored or what?)&quot;",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:10): if he is an experienced programmer and knows his platform...",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:11): well.. i dont think that i am the worst or best programmer... but qt isnt that easy to port i think",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:11): i think its a lot of work",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:11): and he is like &quot;ahh i will port it anyway (when i am bored)&quot;",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:12): hehe",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:12): to what os does he want to port it?",

        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:12): well he lives like 25km away from me ;)",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:13): and i go to the same school like he did ^^",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:13): but reading on skyos.org lets you know he gets things done, and fast",

        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:13): we think that is the first human who was able to clone itself and now he has like 5 robert's at home who are working for him",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:13): that would be a good project, to port Qt to his skyos",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:14): hehe",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:14): ZEROblue, well.. he isnt porting it...",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:14): its amazing how he finds time to do it all.. or well, how he does it all in so shrot time",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:14): and he isnt making all about skyos.... we are making parts too... but the main system is all from him",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (04:15): Well, if he wrote the core and the windowing system, he should have no problems porting it himself.",
        "86ec5627dfe80cac1a06bc97c23bb800 (04:15): maybe someone ports it eventually, Qt will help to improve the userbase on any platform i think",
        "d830a445af00e3de0d2244cc20b67b76 (04:15): ahigerd: he did",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (04:16): It's a fair amount of legwork but should be cake for someone with that kind of knowledge of the OS",
