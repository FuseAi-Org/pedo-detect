        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (13:25): heycam: yo",
        "4dd217ba7542bb00a127f682e2c3ad27 (13:26): needs massive amounts of coffee :-)",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:26): hehe",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (13:27): is lucky never to have gotten on the coffee monkey",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (13:28): is driven by sheer paranoia :)",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:28): only got that monkey off his back about 4 months ago. I found it makes no difference (except I no longer get headaches when I don't have it!)",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:29): life editin specs' is a rush, man! :P",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (13:29): oh, you sad little man",

        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:30): Shapazu, did you see the interview I did with Harry Halpin?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (13:30): I saw the first part... I intend to watch the rest tomorrow",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:31): oh ok. He's a crazy fun dude :) I really liked hanging out with him while I was in the UK.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:32): I'm hoping he will come to TPAC.",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (13:33): yeah, Harry's awesome",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (13:33): he's like a standards rockstar",

        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:38): Arve (or anyone or twitterverse :P ), why is multi-part MIME  unsuitable for widget packaging?",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:51): argh... I hate it when I need to learn new stuff and do my own thinking...",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (13:51): :)",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:11): Ok, keeping in mind I don't really know MIME, here are some thoughts as to why MIME is unsuitable:",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:11): 1. lack of packaging tools for MIME (zip is more prevalent and ships with almost every OS)",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:11): 2. difficult for authors to work with compared to zip: zip is built into many operating systems (such as WindowsXP/Vista) and allows authors to easily modify the content of packages.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:11): 3. lack of compression",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:11): 4. all widget engines already support Zip, so using MIME would be &quot;going against the grain&quot; with regards to standardization and would delay implementation as widget engines may need to be significantly changed to support MIME.",

        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:14): 2) Compression inefficiency",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:14): you are just using fancy words for what i said :)",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:15): there is basically a 8/6 inefficiency you suffer for Base-64",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:15): I need to convince the TAG to stop pushing MIME on us",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:16): [hidden]",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:16): That zip is ubiquotus should alone be enough",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:16): yeah, that's what I think too",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:17): browsers/UAs already support zip",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:17): supporting multipart is, at best, a bolt-on in FF",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:17): and I know of exactly zero tools that will allow me to to take a lump of files from a disk and create a sensible multipart",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:19): and I do not believe that parties who've invested in the widget economy/landscape are willing to wait until 2012 for the same tool support",
        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:20): if anything, I think we should specify the relevant subset of zip in an open industry group",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:21): I guess that's what we will have in the packaging spec.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:21): (the relevant subset)",

        "85793dd1775fbc0c0562493f069bcaa2 (14:22): I'd ideally like to see the compression algorithms in such a separate spec",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (14:23): Well, we only support one at the moment. And it is in a separate spec.",
