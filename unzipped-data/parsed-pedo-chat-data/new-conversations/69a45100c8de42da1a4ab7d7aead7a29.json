        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:58): is there any element name remotely similar to &lt;figcaption&gt;?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:01): yay consensus.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:01): (assuming we even get consensus.)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:01): Are you tempted to remove it from w3c HTML5 just so it can be added later when &lt;legend&gt; is viable? :P",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:02): never though i'd see that many complaints about doing something shelley asked for so quickly",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:02): Only because you did it voluntarily",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:02): You have to wait for the WG decision",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:04): personally i'd rather drop them both too until &lt;legend&gt; works",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:05): next time i think of adding something like this i'll make sure it really works, parser-wise, before adding it, since it's easier to keep something popular out than to remove it later.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:05): yeah, and it's pretty costly at the price of two new elements :/",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:06): still, at least we can point to this as proof the WHATWG is trying to cooperate :-)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:07): Just find another w3c technology that predates details and does the same thing :P",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:07): still doesn't see why making a new element name is worse than overloading an existing name to have different meanings depending on context",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:08): More rules to remember",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:08): Maybe I should just define [HTML5] in html5-diff as the WHATWG copy :p",
