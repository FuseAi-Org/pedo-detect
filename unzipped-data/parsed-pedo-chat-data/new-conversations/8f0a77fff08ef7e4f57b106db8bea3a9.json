        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (04:39): I sort of hate how people assume that Webkit CSS extensions are the future",

        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (04:40): hmm, IE8 doesn't support HTML data URLs? FAIL",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (04:42): Ah, I just want to uncheck &quot;Unofficial&quot; and then I'm happy",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:43): I wouldn't mind a &quot;hide stuff that isn't ready&quot; checkbox, just to see what little is actually usable",

        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (04:46): that page says it supports data URIs for image and stylesheet loads, but not HTML loads",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (04:46): or something like that",
