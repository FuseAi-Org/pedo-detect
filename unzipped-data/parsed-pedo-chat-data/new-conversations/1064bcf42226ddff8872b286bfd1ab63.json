        "306e1b5f004917e22911885474748aed (22:59): not exactly offtopic but not *use* questions either... to get started in vim, I suspect the 'vimtutor' is probably the best place to start... does vim support things like line numbers, code folding, code highlighting? Also, is vi == vim? is vim practically installed on all modern Linux desktops, is it the defacto standard of cli editors? I want to try and learn it, any advice?",
        "61894b21be75260c4964065b1eecec4d (23:01): vi is the original editor from the late seventies",

        "d711e4c8dbc8ccb10d953ab45ad18a36 (23:04): but it is not vi",
        "306e1b5f004917e22911885474748aed (23:07): phrakture: ok, that is good to know. forgive me. to some, vim is a cli app and scary and a gui editor seems preferred by most (even me at some point)... *but* noticing, how effective it is in cli only environments where no gui might exist, I see the power of knowing such an editor... I have n00b questions *but* ask also to get a feel for the IRC community...",
