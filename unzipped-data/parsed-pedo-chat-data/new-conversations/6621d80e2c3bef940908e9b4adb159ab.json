        "398e3848552c55d931d7ae4b48ffea40 (09:21): Asa found a bug earlier that let points double up. the 210 should be the correct number of points",
        "398e3848552c55d931d7ae4b48ffea40 (09:21): i've fixed it and it will be in the next update",

        "398e3848552c55d931d7ae4b48ffea40 (09:22): there is a link to reset your point total on the about:cheevo page if you wanted to start over",
