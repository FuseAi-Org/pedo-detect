        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (02:46): Hey everyone! Quick question. How does firefox do with Visual Studio 2010?",
        "0aa51a9d03871edd7f4e71ddab8323c5 (02:49): huh? it builds just fine usually",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (02:50): Oh ok. I'm thinking about upgrading to 2010 (for some other side projects of mine), and I want to make sure that it won't break any mozilla functionality.",
        "0aa51a9d03871edd7f4e71ddab8323c5 (02:56): b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: wel, its been a while but I'm pretty sure there's alot of people who build with it",
        "0aa51a9d03871edd7f4e71ddab8323c5 (02:57): err, while since I've built on !linux",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (02:57): I see that it can compile on express edition. So i take it that FF doesn't use any ATL or MFC.",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (02:57): Because you can't get those in express versions.",
        "177f465fd068753b23e7e37e62c0d93b (03:00): correct, it does not",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:05): I think Microsoft should also come out with a command line only version of the visual C++ compiler, like linux has gcc. Unless they do, and I don't know it.",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:06): I hate that you have to install the whole graphical IDE just to get the compiler.",

        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:08): Yeah a log time ago, I have no idea where that patch went",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:09): 898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580: Ha ha. No prob then.",
        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:09): I did look for it recently but to no avail, which is strange, could have sworn I kept it around somewhere",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:09): McBride is the new owner of the addons right?",
        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:09): yep",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:10): OK. I dropped him an email last night. So hopefully he will respond soon.",

        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:11): As a rough idea, you have to have the search engine manager component call AddonManagerPrivate.registerProvider and supply it with an object that implements all the methods expected",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:12): Ok.",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:12): Where does the search engine manager component live?",
        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:12): Here is some example code that I wrote a while ago to do that that may be a good resource. It is a little outdated but many of the methods are the same: http://www.oxymoronical.com/blog/2010/07/How-to-extend-the-new-Add-ons-Manager",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:13): 898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580: Thanks",

        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:17): b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: During the development of Firefox 4 when I wrote the initial search engine stuff we were working in a different mercurial repository. Looks like the changes I made are still in there so with a bit of digging you could probably put together a rough idea of what the changes were, see all the changesets here with my name on them; http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/addonsmgr/log/11169b0f10ab/tool",

        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:19): Maybe just comparing this version of that file with the current version in mozilla-central would tell you a lot: http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/addonsmgr/log/11169b0f10ab/toolkit/components/search/nsSearchService.jshttp://hg.mozilla.org/projects/addonsmgr/log/11169b0f10ab/toolkit/components/search/nsSearchService.js",

        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (03:21): So basically, this javascript code is what allows you to change search providers on the search box?",
        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:21): Again, a little outdated so will be in need to tinkering with but should get you a long way",
        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:22): That code and some other code somewhere that handles the actual UI element",

        "898fc6ecff9a5867e6455f37fba81580 (03:22): gavin is the owner of the search engine stuff so you may also want to chat with him at some point once you've got a good idea of how you're doing it",

        "b9477d3127c5eb606e60a7271f68029f (03:24): it's definitely more recent than the firefox stuff, anyway",
