        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:08): At least it looks much better in Opera than when I last looked - it's very broken, but not so broken that you can't see how broken it is :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:09): (I think the rendering in IE6 counts as 'too broken' - it just looks like a really boring and slightly buggy page, and doesn't tempt you with the promise of interestingness if only a few small browser bugs were fixed)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:10): i'm not really targetting IE",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:12): (Konqueror gives an Opera-like level of very-brokenness)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:22): (Ooh, KDE4's Konqueror does surprisingly well - it appears to get the whole layout correct, and it just fails the 1st and 3rd buckets and says &quot;0%&quot; at the end)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (02:23): time to hunt for khtml bugs then? :)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:23): click the &quot;Acid3&quot; text to get a report of what failed",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:25): 34, 35, 37, it says",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:26): but half the time it asks me if I want to Save As / Open / Cancel the empty.txt file",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:27): (The other half the time, it fails doesn't ask but it fails 48 and 49)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:31): I bet 34 is because comments are not preserved in the DOM",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:43): SGML does not say anything about parsing into a DOM afaik",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:52): feel free to fix the bugs, btw",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:52): for the love of kittens don't _not_ fix bugs because acid3's early versions trigger them :-P",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:53): promotes test as an example of 'corner cases with no relevance to the real web, which can safely be ignored'",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:54): Just to be the first to do so ;)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (02:56): WebKit is borking the layout much worse now, though still failing the same number of tests",
