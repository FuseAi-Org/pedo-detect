        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (13:44): what does solaris have in the way of LVM / EVMS?",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (13:51): hi all. Anyone got a little time to answer a kernel question? I'm having a little trouble with a device node showing up as elxl1 instead of elxl0, and I don't know how to change it, or even where to look. Where I *have* looked has been at the system administration manuals (basic and advanced), neither of which has covered what I'm trying to do.",
        "d1987796df25df13abd3f572a0803319 (14:12): Why do you want to change it, instead of accepting that bus probe device order is like the lottery and you should be thankful your devices don't change around on a daily basis?",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:14): Because (as I said somewhere else) several services are dependent on being able to bring up elxl0, and I've no idea why or how. The only clear indication I have is that hostname.elxl0 file, the rest is all buried away in the filesystem somewhere.",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:14): wonder if I fiddled boot-archive somehow? Would that work?",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (14:16): look at path_to_inst, but i really wouldnt be futzing with it",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:16): Damn. X just died... blech.",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:16): Is that the literal filename?",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (14:19): /etc/path_to_inst",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:19): ohhh.",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (14:20): read the manpage",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:21): Viking667, hey",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:21): looks (to me anyhow) like all I have to do is remove one line, and renumber 1 to 0 in the other line.",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:21): hi threat2. Do I know you?",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (14:21): again, read the manpage",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:22): ... And I'll have to do that from WITHIN Solaris, as it gets pissy with me if I try modifying the file from Linux.",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:22): silk: thanks. You've been quite a help. I don't think I would have seen this in any of the documents I've got, and I've got a whole lot.",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:22): Viking667, you look familiar",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:27): That is possible. I've been around for ten years.",
        "d1987796df25df13abd3f572a0803319 (14:27): but it's the smell that gives it away",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:27): not on here, of course.",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:27): AJ_Z0: why, thank you.",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:28): Anyhow, it looks like I have to pick this up in 12 hours or so. Night, all.",
        "d1987796df25df13abd3f572a0803319 (14:28): IIRC, you should also check driver_alises. It's been a long time since I picked a device numbering fight with Solaris",
        "d1987796df25df13abd3f572a0803319 (14:28): (ie. in addition to path_to_inst, as silk mentioned)",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:28): Well, what I've seen looks like exactly what I wanted, though I'm also examining the pages for drvconfig and add_drv just to make sure I'm not led up a dark alley.",
        "d1987796df25df13abd3f572a0803319 (14:29): You deep up the back passage already",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:30): heh...",
        "f9626c170e365419f74c82d3ada49059 (14:30): We//, anyhow I'm out of here. Night.",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:51): AJ_Z0, lol",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:52): so any way, does solaris have some type of LVM/EVMS?",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:52): meta something or other",
        "d8566b438dd801b12714f11c01b224a0 (14:54): meta DEVICE?  :)",

        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:54): ok",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:55): and SVM supports what exactly? is there a site that explains its features?",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (14:56): Funnily enough, docs.sun.com",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:56): heh",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:56): that is funny",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (14:56): Whats that?",
        "d1987796df25df13abd3f572a0803319 (14:58): SVM, formerly SDS, formerly ODS, supports most RAID configs in software and is the best LVM for system disks",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (14:59): oh, so it supports being on a RAID disk? or is supports / provides sotfware RAID functionaility itself?",
        "d8566b438dd801b12714f11c01b224a0 (14:59): both",
        "d8566b438dd801b12714f11c01b224a0 (15:00): it does RAID and software partitioning",
        "d8566b438dd801b12714f11c01b224a0 (15:00): soft partitioning rather",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (15:00): and soft partitions",
        "1b51569779af61ca040906ebfd79ab19 (15:00): _Tenchi_, nice",
        "d8566b438dd801b12714f11c01b224a0 (15:01): ZFS is nice as well",
        "d8566b438dd801b12714f11c01b224a0 (15:01): you've got a lot of reading to do",
        "d1987796df25df13abd3f572a0803319 (15:01): ZFS and VxVM are different tools better suited to different jobs"
