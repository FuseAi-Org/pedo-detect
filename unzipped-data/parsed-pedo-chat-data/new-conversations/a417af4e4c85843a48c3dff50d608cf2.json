I don't know what a &quot;split&quot; is or how the US and Christain calendars differ.",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:15): Might as well make the conversion somewhat harder so people will just store dates using timestamps anyway.  Yay!",

We keep time with a mixed-radix system based on both days (and composites of such) and seconds (and composites of such).  Converting from seconds-based time to days-and-seconds-based time is approximately equally difficult to just converting from seconds-based to days-based.)",
