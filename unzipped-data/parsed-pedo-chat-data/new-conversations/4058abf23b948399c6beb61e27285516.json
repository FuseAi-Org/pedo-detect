        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:01): since it's used in other ways to describe interactions with processes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:02): attaching to a thread somewhat implies a debugger actually monitoring the thread",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:02): ah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:02): which is not what this is",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:02): right, I see",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:02): but in the absence of a better term...",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:03): hmm, only other word I can think of is &quot;tether&quot;, and that probably sucks more",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:03): heh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:04): i used join, but joining a thread means waiting for it to complete, which isn't the same thing at all :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:04): so attach is a step in the right direction",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:04): but merely a small step",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:04): &quot;connect&quot;?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:05): could work",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:06): hook, tie, bind, pin, fasten, harness",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:06): and &quot;hog tie&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:07): connect is winning so far",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:12): connect is best, since what you get back is a message port",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (13:12): connectToNamedWorker",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:13): it's still createNamedWorker() for consistency with createWorker()",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:13): the name 'connect' is the event name",
        "bb76dfcc4f591df0120c3ef31743d8e2 (13:14): How about assign?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:14): unless you think it should be connectToNamedWorker() and connectToWorker(), or connectToNamedWorker() and createWorker() ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:15): why assign?",
        "bb76dfcc4f591df0120c3ef31743d8e2 (13:16): connect makes me think of connections and pipes and such",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:16): well the message ports did used to be called pipes",
        "bb76dfcc4f591df0120c3ef31743d8e2 (13:18): But that's for inter-worker communication, isn't it? Not for task-to-worker",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:22): i don't understand what you mean",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:22): message ports are how any two things communicate",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:22): whether they be in different workers, same worker, different frames, whatever",
        "bb76dfcc4f591df0120c3ef31743d8e2 (13:25): Just me being confused, then.",

        "bb76dfcc4f591df0120c3ef31743d8e2 (13:28): I should add it to my OKRs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:31): something else we could use &lt;browserbutton&gt; for is the ability to move a page into the background completely",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:31): so e.g. you could hide google calendar and it could still be doing toast notifications of your events"
