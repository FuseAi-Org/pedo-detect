        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (23:13): plus an h1 would be &quot;easier&quot; to maintain. DRY",

        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (23:32): so basically it would not do a lot of harm",

        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (23:35): It's the third most common element, after html and head which every single document has because they're added automatically by the parser :-)",

        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (23:36): but imagine that the browser takes h1 for the title of the window and for bookmarking.",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (23:36): I guess many h1 are a substring of title. or maybe not",
