        "b0a67262ff72bc7b01b3c3607616f38e (01:43): its kinda ironic how switzerland sells their 'green' rules and have the worlds biggest nuclear test facility under it hehe. fucking 3 eyed fish and 8 armed wigglemonkeys and stuff there soon i bet",
        "9f68ab96646717c9ac631f53a3130c5a (01:45): errm, particle physics and nuclear weapons aren't exactly the same thing",
        "b0a67262ff72bc7b01b3c3607616f38e (01:49): PerterB: well, from what ive read, you cant go neer the collector/analyser for 15 years after its powered down :&gt;",
        "b0a67262ff72bc7b01b3c3607616f38e (01:49): thats scary enough",

        "9f68ab96646717c9ac631f53a3130c5a (01:51): I'm somewhat surprised... I know they plan to collide a lot of particles at very high energies, but most of the resultant particles are meant to have insanely short half-lives",
        "b0a67262ff72bc7b01b3c3607616f38e (01:52): yeah, but its the equipment used to data collecting thats the issue",
        "9f68ab96646717c9ac631f53a3130c5a (01:52): right",
        "b0a67262ff72bc7b01b3c3607616f38e (01:57): is it possible to use pc keyboards on sun hardware, reason is i have a 1u rack mount keyboard i was hoping i could perhaps adapt for this netra t1125 the plug seems to be ps/2 however im not sure how compatible stuff is, any ideas? hopefully i can use the same keyboard via kvm for all the servers including the netra",
        "8c27c6238210e78d0cff9690db08116b (01:57): no, type5 is not ps/2",

        "d1987796df25df13abd3f572a0803319 (02:03): and what PerterB said. &quot;Nuclear&quot; physics meant a different thing back then",

        "8c27c6238210e78d0cff9690db08116b (02:57): Offhand, I'd doubt it, since sun takes extreme pains to make each module hermetic.  ask alanc in #opensolaris for a definitive answer though",
