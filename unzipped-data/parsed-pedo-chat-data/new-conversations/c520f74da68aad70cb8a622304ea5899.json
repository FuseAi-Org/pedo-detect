        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (05:18): Like how there's 2000 lines of 6502 opcode decoding and yet the video code isn't connected to the opcode decoding.",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (05:18): gameboy color is done",

        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (05:22): Similar to the GBC emulator, but the opcode funcs array is dynamically built now",

        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (05:24): like C64 vs Ricoh's custom",
        "6a8ca7ce228632a45b077b5398962bf2 (05:25): most are stable, i.e. predictable",
