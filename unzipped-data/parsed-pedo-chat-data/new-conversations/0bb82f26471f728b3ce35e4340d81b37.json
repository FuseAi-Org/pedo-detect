        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:57): Currently those two parts seem to be confused and mixed together",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:59): Every post seems to echo the same sentiment: &quot;It doesn't matter, the implementations will magically do the right thing without the spec having to state what it is&quot;",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:59): So if magic is making it work, why have a spec at all?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (15:08): wonders if it's sometimes preferable to attribute to malice rather than ignorance to avoid making people look stupid",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (15:34): not entirely. You would get the glass cover over the LCD, like on the new MacBooks with glossy display, but that glass can be coated with anti-reflective coating so it looks glossy without reflecting everything",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (15:34): doesn't like it, but the computer was pretty cheap so he can't expect it to be great",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:36): but the screen on the MacBooks that were current in Q2 of 2008 sucks",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:36): I run mine lid closed except when traveling, so it's not a huge problem",
