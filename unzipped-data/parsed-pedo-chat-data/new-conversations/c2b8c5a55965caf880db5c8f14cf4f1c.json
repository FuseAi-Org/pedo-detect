        "9ac93fad7c9a77617c9831c44389c55b (14:29): hmm, can't figure out the clone URL for that repo",

        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (14:45): xspecxref.py and refs.py",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:45): cross-spec xref?",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (14:45): Yes",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:45): oh, references",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:45): right",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:46): hmm",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:47): i guess either I have to get this to run locally or just lose those features for now",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:47): having cross-spec xref and references would be neat -- though not sure how they work with a web interface",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (14:47): Pubrules will probably want more detailed references, though",

        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (14:49): Works for me, then",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (14:49): yeah, it just doesn't for me :/",

        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:23): hey, I am surprised you sent a link to the Checklist to the WHATWG - how come?",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:24): because I want to get wider feedback on that doc",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:24): I would have understood a link to the requirements list, which is in good shape - but the checklist is so much still in raw format, I'm not sure input is helpful at this stage...",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:24): we have so far gotten almost zero feedback on it",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:25): we have not gotten much feedback on the requirements either",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:25): and we need to have a sense of urgency about that",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:25): we do not have infinite amounts of time to get implementors to wait for us",

        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:27): I'm just wondering if feedback to the checklist can be useful at this stage",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:27): we've had some edits earlier this week, which I had to remove again because they were solution-specific rather than general technology area",

        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:29): it's in an intermediate state - all the feedback at this stage can be only on the requirements realistically, which has its own page",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:30): the whole page will be re-organised by technology still to become actual checklists",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:31): getting feedback on the requirements would be awesome though",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:31): 040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721: It sounds like feedback now is a great idea",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:32): it's not feedback then, but rather input",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:32): No point in doing a big refactoring of things people don't like",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (15:32): Is there a difference?",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:33): what refactoring? there is no refactoring - it's about making checklists that make sense from a technology POV rather than a disability POV",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:34): also, one obvious critique right now is on the priorities - none of which have been discussed or consciously set yet",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (15:35): well, there are no priorities",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:36): yup, that's another thing that is on the todo for this page still - it's on the agenda",
        "040342c014ffc1c11592948bd92e3721 (15:36): but anyway - I'm sure the &quot;feedback&quot; will be good input into the process, so go ahead :)",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:01): by not removing the formatting elements from the stack when removing them from the list",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (16:04): with your proposal it's still easy to cause a DoS, just have different attributes on each element",
