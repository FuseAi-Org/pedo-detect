        "b45082526d2f65fa02eee54f1a7995fc (02:56): the spec clearly says that some should fire synchronously, eg. &quot;must synchronously fire a progress event called loadstart&quot; (4.8.10.4)",
        "b45082526d2f65fa02eee54f1a7995fc (02:56): and others are clearly asynchronous, eg. &quot;must queue a task to fire a simple event called play&quot; (4.8.10.7)",

        "b45082526d2f65fa02eee54f1a7995fc (02:57): so are the ready state change events fired differently from others?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:58): &quot;fire a simple event&quot; is synchronous, but that doesn't preclude an error in the spec :-)",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (03:29): maybe about letting PR folks solve the problem, just like with 2022?",
