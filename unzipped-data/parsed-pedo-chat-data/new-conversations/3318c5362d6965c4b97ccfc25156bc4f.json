        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:07): &quot;A few of the attributes are VERY popular with authors\u201a\u00c4\u00eeBorder, Width, Cellpadding, and Cellspacing are used in ~90% of all URLs that use tables.&quot;",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:09): Hixie: seems like making those non-conforming is an uphill battle",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:09): I don't see useful gain from it",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (13:11): is still incapable of remembering the CSS equivalents of cellpadding and cellspacing, and has to look it up every time he writes a table",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:13): 'border-spacing' and 'padding', I think",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:13): though I can't remember exactly what the cellpadding attribute does, so I could be wrong",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:15): yep, according to HTML4, it just adds padding to the cell, so: td { padding: 10px; } should be equivalent to cellpadding=10",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (13:16): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: It's more like &lt;style&gt;#table-of-stuff td, #table-of-stuff th { padding: 10px; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;table id=&quot;table-of-stuff&quot;&gt; to be equivalent to &lt;table cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;&gt;",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (13:16): which is a big pain",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:17): yeah, I know. I just simplified it",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (13:17): Just thinking of ids for tables is a difficult task for me :-(",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:18): part of the problem with those attributes is that so many tools generate tables that contain those attributes by default.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:18): TextMate certainly does it when you use the insert table shortcut",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (13:22): To get the same effect as cellspacing=0, I think I have to something with border-collapse which gets all complicated and buggy",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (13:22): (I've hit the same border-collapse bug in Firefox on two entirely independent occasions)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:23): what border-collapse bug?",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (13:26): Something to do with rendering collapsed borders in tables with rowspans or something like that, but I don't remember exactly what it was now",

        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (14:38): Raytracing is 3D, and uses lots more rays - you cast a single ray per pixel, find the nearest object it hits, and then cast a load more rays to do shadows and reflections and all the other fancy effects you want, and then finally you draw the pixel by combining all those rays",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (14:38): (I think a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9's statement was entirely wrong)",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (14:40): Anyway, real-time raytracing is a silly idea since you can get much better performance and much better control by hacking on polygon rasterisers :-)",
        "3f2e2531201cfbf853f16f668132eaf2 (14:41): and you get photorealistic rendering by giving good tools to good artists who know how to cheat to make it look real, rather than by accurately modelling the physics of light",
