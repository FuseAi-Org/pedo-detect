        "5a2f1c3667886a3c922e7ad2f06ca9b8 (00:05): there isn't one specific document as far as i know. there's the solaris 10 hcl, which would be a good starting point",
        "5a2f1c3667886a3c922e7ad2f06ca9b8 (00:06): for wireless drivers, see the opensolaris wireless page.",
        "d9afc81a74a6157c22ffe85cb0845541 (00:06): it supports my wman card :)",

        "1541ec103df39991b473b86511ce273f (00:08): Anyway, your best bet is to try and see for yourself.",
        "5ef382098221da582785caed3b8d84c3 (00:08): i've found the hcl to be fairly weak",
        "0be7c7238ec16b796087346943fbb959 (00:09): or just ask about your hardware. Someone here may know.",
        "1541ec103df39991b473b86511ce273f (00:09): The Solaris 10 HCL is better.",
        "1541ec103df39991b473b86511ce273f (00:09): All that stuff there pretty much works too. Mailing lists, google, etc. also help",

        "1541ec103df39991b473b86511ce273f (00:21): But like I said, just TRY and see. As long as you don't have crap, it should work.",

        "1541ec103df39991b473b86511ce273f (00:21): And there's 3rd party drivers too. Lots of them.",
