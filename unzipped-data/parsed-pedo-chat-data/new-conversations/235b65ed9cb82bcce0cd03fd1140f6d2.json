I haven't seen a volunteer yet and if no one does it then the IANA approach will win by default, which would be unfortunate given the number of people advocating the microformats wiki instead",

        "33ad25ed5e7950dce85e69b1a4fa8a20 (23:44): why does executeSql work async?",
        "33ad25ed5e7950dce85e69b1a4fa8a20 (23:44): is the fact the transaction callback is run asynchronously already not enough?",

        "33ad25ed5e7950dce85e69b1a4fa8a20 (23:57): you have no way to enumerate DBs, and no way to learn the current version",

If you want Web SQL DB resurrected, convince Mozilla and Microsoft to implement it (I'll spec the SQL profile if necessary). If you want IndexedDB to not suck, send comments on it, it's a work in progress.",
