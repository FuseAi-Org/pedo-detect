        "a6af29dc5df2b24efb0c6d14ffb6f23a (15:32): and the mark of the last edited line of the current file is '. not '0",
        "a6af29dc5df2b24efb0c6d14ffb6f23a (15:34): 16:39 &lt; avlondono&gt; PlasmaHH: :he last-position-jump, :he 'viminfo",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:39): no, I dont have such a command, since it was working without it in 6.x and people expressed that such a command wasnt necessary",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:42): PlasmaHH: well, they were wrong. the autocmd has to be *somewhere*. maybe it was in your system-wide vimrc previously and now it isn't, but it has to be somewhere",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:44): Hideo_Kuze: how are you starting vim in the terminal?",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:44): jamessan: hm, yeah, looks like it is in some files in the 6.x installations...",
        "a6af29dc5df2b24efb0c6d14ffb6f23a (15:44): certainly some other people (at least me) and the help disagree from the beginning.",
        "a6af29dc5df2b24efb0c6d14ffb6f23a (15:45): and as jamessan said, you need it",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:45): jamessan: hm, its also here in /etc/vimrc ...",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:45): jamessan: is it possible that for some reason the /etc/vimrc isnt read in?",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:46): jamessan: I just typed in vim",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:46): jamessan: and if yes, how to check and/or fix?",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:46): Hideo_Kuze: do you see &quot;+xterm_clipboard&quot; in the output of &quot;:version&quot; ?",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:47): PlasmaHH: check &quot;:scriptnames&quot;",

        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:48): jamessan:  no /etc/vimrc there, hm...",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:48): jamessan: should that have been enabled during compile time?",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:48): Hideo_Kuze: it is for certain Vim packages, but not all. it seems like your alternatives are pointing at two different vim binaries for gvim and vim",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:49): jamessan: ok, I just sourced it in my .vimrc ... thanks for your help, works now",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:49): PlasmaHH: you can see in &quot;:version&quot; where Vim thinks the system-wide vimrc should be",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:49): $VIM/vimrc ...",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:50): jamessan: so all I have to do is update-alternatives right",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:51): Hideo_Kuze: yeah, although this shouldn't happen unless the alternatives were manually changed already.  all the variants that support X have higher priority than those that don't",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:52): PlasmaHH: &quot;:version&quot; also shows what $VIM will fallback to, so you can check that $VIM/vimrc exists",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:53): jamessan: hm, yeah, it says it fallbacks to /etc ...",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (15:53): but it currently is /usr/share/vim/current ...",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:54): jamessan: it did not work still",

        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:54): Hideo_Kuze: what does &quot;update-alternatives --display vim&quot; say?",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:55): PlasmaHH: that's not right...",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:55): it should be &quot;/usr/share/vim&quot;",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:55): PlasmaHH: did you perform the echo in Vim?",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:55): excuse my paste,  vim - status is manual. link currently points to /usr/bin/vim.basic",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:56): Current `best' version is /usr/bin/vim.gtk.",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:56): Hideo_Kuze: the first line was all I needed :)",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:56): Hideo_Kuze: that should point to vim.gtk",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (15:58): Hideo_Kuze: so, it looks like you adjusted the alternative before which is why it is in manual mode",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:59): hm... I haven't touched it in ages",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:59): wonder what caused the change",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (15:59): but it works now, thanks a lot, jamessan :)",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (16:00): so by default it should be auto right",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (16:00): yup",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (16:01): it changes to manual when the user makes a change or the maintainer handles things improperly",
        "0545a210619f3b4e8a2caad724f14da9 (16:02): thank you jamessan, it's way less irritating now :)",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (16:02): jamessan: yes I did",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (16:02): Hideo_Kuze: welcome :)",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (16:03): PlasmaHH: well, that's not correct at all. do you happen to have $VIM set in the shell, too?",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (16:03): jamessan: no, its not set there. and if $VIM should contain /usr/share/vim then /usr/share/vim/current is right here probably",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (16:04): PlasmaHH: are you running Debian?",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (16:05): nope",
        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (16:06): the question for me is, why doesnt it contain /etc ?",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (16:07): $VIM is usually the parent directory of $VIMRUNTIME",
        "878b627b013f0c465ec2be26325ce80d (16:07): so, it wouldn't normally be /etc",

        "e08552c860faa32d1cddd42d124f5208 (16:11): hm, on the other system with 6.4 its the same, but there the /etc/vimrc is read in, so I suspect some read in/set $VIM order has changed",
        "a6af29dc5df2b24efb0c6d14ffb6f23a (16:29): PlasmaHH: in some systems /usr/share/vim/vimrc is simply a symbolic link to /etc/.../vimrc, but vim doesn't read that file through the /etc almost never (the only one that I've seen doing it is gentoo).",
        "ded01cf47cdca62f9adcfd25cb1b3127 (16:30): gentoo doesn't do that",

        "c67290fbbbc18812b36af761e243bf4c (16:52): no idea",
        "4969e383a78d3407b54160eb0de4b90b (16:52): It was more of a question of internals, to developers... I might have a look at hacking that into the source code if I get a moment..."
