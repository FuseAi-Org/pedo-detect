        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:52): If the user then stays local to his system, the DC will not hear from him again. It will have no idea whether he stays logged on for 2 seconds or 2 weeks",
        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (08:52): say he selects local machine",
        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (08:53): does that authenticate with the domain controller?",
        "cafed4bc87d513362c670aa23f0b1ba6 (08:53): what is DC?",
        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (08:53): ok",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:53): When he selects local machine, then authentication is local, and the DC is not involved.",

        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (08:53): quux, so in a bussiness setup do users usually authenticate with the domain?",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:53): Think of the localmachine as a domain - which can only include one PC",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:54): In a normal business setup, authentication takes place at the DC is it is available.",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:54): However, Win NT, W2000, XP, and so on can cache a login once the DC has authenticated it, in case the DC is not avilable later",

        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:57): Are you thinking that if we make an ACL on the local machine hold a global group, how would the user access things protected by that global group when the DC is unavailable?",
        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (08:57): yeah",

        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:58): The answer is: when a username/password is authenticated at a DC, the DC sends back a token that basically says 'authentication passed; user is a member of the following domain groups'",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:59): The client machine caches that token which includes the list of groups",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (08:59): And that's how a cached login can access a local resource protected by an acl including DOMAIN\\SOMEGROUP",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (09:00): (better way to put it: an ACE specifying DOMAIN\\SOMEGROUP)",
        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (09:03): it says don ;t make local groups for users in a domain based network",

        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (09:04): I suspect that more specifically it says don't create local groups on the DC and then use them on resource servers or client machines",
        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (09:04): okies",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (09:05): This always confuses people. For instance: the Administrator of a domain controller is *not* a Domain Administrator by default, and shouldn't be made one",
        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (09:05): right",
        "4ce8125bb9cd1c00021f9e1edef15041 (09:05): I understand that",
