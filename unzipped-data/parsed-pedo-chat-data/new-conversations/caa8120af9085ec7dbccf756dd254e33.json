        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:30): hmm, looks like html5lib doesn't parse the contents of the noscript element",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:36): i don't understand this interest in splitting out html5 using this new scheme",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:36): i've never seen a spec do this before",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:37): (the &quot;implementation&quot; vs &quot;authoring&quot; split that some people want)",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:38): that one doesn't make much sense to me either. DOM initialization vs. post DOM initialization is more sensible (parser/script dependencies notwithstanding). another more sensible split would be old stuff vs. new stuff",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:43): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: which &quot;consistency and stability claims&quot; are overblown and how are they overblown?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:44): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: also, how is the HTML5 change control unsatisfactory?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:45): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, well jgraham is claiming that the parser section is so stable that nothing further can happen without major browser implementation",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:45): yet html5lib doesn't even do what the spec says regarding noscript",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:45): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: i doubt he thinks that _nothing_ further can happen",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:46): &quot;the parsing work is stable to the extent that it can be without having implementations in major-marketshare browsers&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:46): but it's certainly true that we're mostly just waiting for wide-scale implementation experience",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:46): well that's true",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:46): it's as stable as it can ever be without wide-scale implementation experience",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:46): that doesn't mean nothing further can happen",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:46): even a completely stable spec can change",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:47): just not much",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:47): even a shipped product (the epitomy of stable) can change, e.g. security fixes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:47): CSS2 was as stable as it gets, yet look at the amount of change _it_ went through",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:49): just saying there's an obvious delta between the spec and a library that most major html5 contributors have commit access to",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:49): so?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:50): surprised it could happen",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:50): really?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:50): dude, all software has bugs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:50): all specs have bugs",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:50): well, surprised it's never even been noticed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:50): i hate to be the one to break it to you",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:52): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: also, how is the HTML5 change control unsatisfactory?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:52): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, I don't like the explicit private feedback challenges",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:52): er",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:52): channels",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:53): yeah, nor do i",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:53): like, I am guessing you did not invent MessagePort",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:53): maybe I am wrong about that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:53): sadly, some people don't want to say anything in public because their products are secret, or whatnot",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:53): invent how?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:53): it was quite different from the Apple and Mozilla proposals as I recall",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:54): proposals for what?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:54): do you mean the worker stuff?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:54): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:54): workers are unrelated to messageport really",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:54): though i did reuse them for that purpose since it seemed useful",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:55): well, at any rate, I never proposed a course of action",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:55): (messageport though, the api, was basically something i wrote up based on a series of proposals related to capabilities APIs through messages)",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:55): I just don't think other editorial splits are obviously bad",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:56): oh some are definitely good",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:56): like we should split out the storage stuff eventually",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:56): especially if someone is willing to do a document",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:56): since that's pretty self-contained",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:56): even if you don't suggest it",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (04:56): anyway, gtg",
