        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:06): Xinux, what do you mean? Place your speakers to the right of the place you sit :-D",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:06): grandrew, ?????????????",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:06): oh",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:07): 130825&lt;Xinux&gt; is it possible for an integrated sound card to process the right speakers sound but not the lefts ? &lt;&lt;-- i dont get it",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:07): you mean about my sound card",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:07): nobody gets it i guess :P",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:07): or its inactive ?",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:07): =\\",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:07): okay",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:07): I get sound in my right speaker",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:07): but not my left",
        "cb3851827df6ea57057fd52e3a2b273e (11:08): alrighty...   choice between the PCI-E x1 &amp; the PCI-E x4 for a SATA II RAID adapter...  will I see a significantly reduced speed with PCI-E x1?",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:08): CLxyz, if you disconnect CPU, and try to boot MB, it should start but fail at the CPU test. If it does not, chances you've got the dead mb. power switch is harder to test",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:09): Xinux, check connections and your mixer settings",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:09): brick, i've done that",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:09): dont think it has anything to do with it",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:10): because if I plugin headphones, it plays in the right speaker of the headphones only",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:10): Xinux, you may have a dead amplifier at the left",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:10): hi brick",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:10): grandrew, if that were the case, left sound would still be tehre",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:10): and I would hear it in my headphoines",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:10): mixer settings",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:10): nope",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:10): already tried it",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:10): though it is possible that one channel be dead, i find it unlikely",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:11): umm",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:11): connections is the most common case BUT the amp and preamp is separated for each channel inside the chip",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:11): that would be the only likely explanation",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:11): even if the left speaker WAS broken",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:12): wouldnt I get the left sound in my headphones",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:12): the same happens on linux",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:12): for example, if you connect -12v power lines to the right speaker signal, you may end up with dead right amp :D",
        "318585162e24b714e699b4533681f282 (11:12): grandrew:",
        "318585162e24b714e699b4533681f282 (11:13): I see power lights (onboard LAN lights up, there's another LED that lights up) on the motherboard",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:13): i'm telling you, its definately not a dead speaker.",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:14): and i'm telling you it may be dead amplifier in your internal soundcard chip",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:14): and i'm hoping thats not the case",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:14): =)",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:15): and i'm also telling you how could you fry your amp",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:15): sure, if he's been doing that kind of thing :)",
        "cb3851827df6ea57057fd52e3a2b273e (11:16): so what's the speed difference between PCI-E x1 and PCI-E x4?   Will I notice a big difference between RAID adapters of either slot?",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:16): grandrew, don't know.",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:16): in fact, eventually I was that sort of thing myself :-)",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:16): could just be because this computer is old....",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:16): *was doing",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:17): CLxyz, maybe graphics card?",
        "318585162e24b714e699b4533681f282 (11:18): working gfx pulled from another machine",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:18): fckin why do i even use the left speaker",
        "318585162e24b714e699b4533681f282 (11:18): oh, and there was &quot;a spark an the power switch&quot; when it died",
        "b814566a9b80be07d57d2f26b05e768f (11:19): hahahha",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:20): drumline, i guess on the very-high-end RAID controllers you can reach the pcix-1 limit of 2.5g with simultaneous reads from many (~10) disks in RAID1",
        "f816abad4e7f7a8a33015ae0f32b844a (11:21): CLxyz, if there was a spark and the lighting, smoke and maybe fire :D you can identify the dead parts visually :-)",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (11:22): &quot;where there's smoke, there's fire&quot; :)",
