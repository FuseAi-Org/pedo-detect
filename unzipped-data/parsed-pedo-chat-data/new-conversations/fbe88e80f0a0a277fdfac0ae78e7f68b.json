I read some web-logs which mentioned Microformats, and while it looks like an interesting approach, some others barely wrote about RDFa.",

I suppose it's because both need to get the recommendation status, but I wanted to check nevertheless. Given there is a DTD for RDFa with XHTML but since HTML5 doesn't use it, I wanted to know how should I start approaching RDFa in HTML5: is it okay to just start using RDFa properties, or do you rather know of/have an example?",
