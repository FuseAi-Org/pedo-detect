        "57676b46c102ac64708711db3e4f4ead (06:33): I have two scripts to start differently configured apaches: one at port 80 and another at port 9909",
        "57676b46c102ac64708711db3e4f4ead (06:34): the problem is that once I start one, the script for the other thinks it's already started because it sees the /usr/sbin/httpd processes running",
        "57676b46c102ac64708711db3e4f4ead (06:34): what's a good way to modify the startup scripts to notice if the http with the right -f flag is running? This is on FC5",
        "1b70f328e83584318ab35ff5c7c96056 (06:34): two things.. obviously apache can run on two ports at the same time, and you haven't explained why you're running two instances..",

        "57676b46c102ac64708711db3e4f4ead (06:36): hm in this case the wrappers are modified from the FC5 startup scripts and don't seem to use apachectl directly. I can paste one to pastebin if that will help",

        "1b70f328e83584318ab35ff5c7c96056 (06:38): apachectl is a script largely simillar to the chkconfig/init.d ones, accepting start and stop etc. as args.",
