        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (23:40): i have a computer that keeps going down, i suspect the power supply, is there any reasonable way to test power supplies, or should i just buy a new one?",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (23:49): variable_office: volt-ohm meter, check the 5, 12, 3.3 volt legs for correct voltage (around 10%)",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (23:50): you can get ATX pinouts everywhere",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (23:50): how much is a volt ohm meter going to run?",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (23:50): personally, if it seems to be the PS and they're not using a quality (enermax, antec, some others) or kinda-quality (FSP) unit, I just change it. Many cheap PSes are crap",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (23:51): variable_office: 10-20$ for a cheapy VO meter that works fine. you *should* already have one",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (23:51): i think i put a good psu in here",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (23:52): I'd suspect motherboard or PSU capacitors these days if it's 2-3 years old; there's so many of those problems",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (23:53): ah",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (23:53): what brands do you consider quality?",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (23:59): PSU: Enermax is my fav.; antec is also good, I heard of a 1-2 others but they don't come to mind right now",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (23:59): frankly, weight is a pretty good measure of ATX PSU quality in my experience. if it's very lightweight, quite certainly it's crap",
        "92c1f658b3d16f2039994a213258cfbf (00:03): question - running an 802.11b AP, is the max bandwidth the AP can send/recieve 11Mb? -or- do individual clients have the potential to send/receive 11Mb seperately from the same AP?",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (00:06): max total network b/w is &quot;11mbit&quot;; due to 802.11 efficiency it's actually about half of that",

        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (00:39): variable_office: nice, but maybe oversized. you'll need insane h/w to use 550 watts",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (00:42): well i am running dual procs in it",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (00:52): I have dual procs, and 9 HDs. my use is ~360W",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (00:53): although thsoe procs are athlon 1.8s so they take less wattage than the new ones",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (00:53): aye",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (00:54): if it turns out to be the mobo as it still crashes after the new psu, the psu cant be damaged by the unstable mobo can it?",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:03): good PSUs should be able to shut down for any wierd voltage condition, incl. a short from the mobo",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:03): ok cool",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:03): well i hope it is the psu, because dual proc mobos arent cheap",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:03): crappier ones may bnot have such protection and may be damaged",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:04): variable_office: how old is it?",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:06): the psu i only like 1.5 years",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:07): the computer is like 3 or 4, its a 2x2200mp system",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:17): I'd say suspect the capacitors on your mobo. what kind of mobo is it?",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:18): gigabyte",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:20): yeah, I think they were hit by the bad caps thing. you may need to replace your caps.",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:20): oooohhhh, so the motherboard may be bad?  the problem with the computer is just that it will randomly reboot, usually when i open an app",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:23): variable_office: try a replacement PS, try running memtest86, but randomly rebooting may mean bad caps.",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:24): ya, i didnt think about memtest",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:24): ill have to do that, i think i lost my old disk, guess ill have to make a new one",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:24): memtest86+",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:26): damn, well if the mobo is bad, i will just scrap the dual 2200s, put those in 2 seperate servers, and get myself a dual 940 board",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:29): hey",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:29): don't scrap the 2 2200MPs, I'll take them off your hands",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:30): no, im not scraping them, they will go in servers",
        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:30): oh, you meant &quot;seperate&quot;. OK.",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:30): yep",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:30): the upcoming voip server will enjoy having one of those",

        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:32): for what?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (01:32): a couple 2200+'s and a working dual Socket A board gets enough dough to buy a real machine",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (01:32): &quot;real&quot; being something thats actually fast (those old dual athlons only share one badly-handled PC2100 bus)",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:33): but if my socket a board is dead it doesnt really help?",

        "5970bd1634756232824f68fe3b6bb725 (01:33): it doesn't reboot or whatever",

        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:34): there was a huge rash of bad caps 2-4 years ago due to taiwanese companies badly pirating a japanese formula. results: caps burst, hw freezes or crashes or doesn't boot.",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:34): J4k3 maybe ill get lucky and the board isnt dead",

        "05346ab3db400d0ed757154ddb3f0800 (01:36): dtm: ooh, that's a pickle. I'd suspect wierd sw/driver issue if it freezes but passes those tests fine",
        "edd5cc28df2a1432c3bd47cbc6fd3403 (01:37): on another note, the HD in one of my servers was clicking, i rebooted and it failed to boot to it, i then let it sit a few minutes and now it boots fine.  do i replace the HD?",
