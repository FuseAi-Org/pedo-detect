        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:00): just reading about it",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:01): Ever use a telephone?",
        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:01): yeah, i've heard about those",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:02): chances are unless you're calling your neighbour, it's probably travelling over SONET, with ATM as the transport.",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:02): so yeah, it's pretty common :)",
        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:02): right, so yeah, common :)",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:02): other than that, leased lines like OC3 use it",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:02): their native transport is SONET",
        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:02): interesting",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:02): but you can peel circuits off using TDM",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:02): what you run over that circuit is your business",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:02): ATM is common, though.",
        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:03): so in situations like core Internet routing, it's typically ATM",
        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:03): right there in the middle of the big 'ol Internet",
        "482e88a50abece27e1db5d6ead96d259 (12:03): yup. to oversimplify it",

        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:37): is the Cisco SDM available to mere mortals, or do you have to have some agreement to get your hands on it?",
        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:37): and would it be something I could use with dynamips?",
        "a4fa04748c9760470a6e17adb48ff9cb (12:38): perhaps the SDM comes on CD when you buy Cisco hardware",
        "10b62ea1d121af33d7cc6d2367e6878e (12:39): you can download it from cisco.com, and it also ships with new devices",
