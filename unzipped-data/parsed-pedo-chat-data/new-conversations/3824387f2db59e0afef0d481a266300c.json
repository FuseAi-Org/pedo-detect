        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (16:44): hi, I'm looking for how to markup a dialog. Any idea?",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:47): 1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd: what kind of dialog?",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (16:47): e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62, I transcribed an interview",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:47): ah",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:47): yeah",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:47): we had an element for that but most people didn't like it",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:48): I don't know what the current markup-expert guidance on that is",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:48): but maybe there's something on the html5 doctors site",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (16:48): e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62, I personnally found the dialog tag very useful",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (16:49): but now its gone",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:49): yeah because most people don't have use for it",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:49): like, we could add a &lt;poem&gt; element too",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:51): I think in general it's best to consider HTML to be more like RTF than like .. Docbook or LaTeX or whatever",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:51): that is, use whatever gets the job done and that brings the least maintenance cost",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:52): as long as it doesn't have accessibility problems or whatever",
        "34b0d246331696992e9ee7235f88ca66 (16:52): wishes there was just no restrictions on tags, just let arbitrary tags",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:52): 99.99% of the universe is never going to read your code or care what markup choices you made",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:53): there are no restrictions actually",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:53): you can use a &lt;dialog&gt; element if you like",
        "34b0d246331696992e9ee7235f88ca66 (16:54): yeh you just need to shim them, I have considered doing a site thats just made up tags for the sake of it, maybe next time",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:55): well anyway the HTML language is a joke as far as semantic richness goes",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:55): it's a lost cause",
        "34b0d246331696992e9ee7235f88ca66 (16:55): agreed",
        "34b0d246331696992e9ee7235f88ca66 (16:56): well, I dont think its a lost cause, but its not something I worry a whole lot about",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:56): it's not something that users worry about at least",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:57): actual users care about the semantics of the HTML source for the Web content they use as they do about the Postscript source for the PDFs they use",
        "34b0d246331696992e9ee7235f88ca66 (16:57): I think a lot of it died with xhtml, if browsers are the only ones who can read html, there isnt much point in it not being an object code for browsers",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:58): there are lots of things other than browsers that can read HTML",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:58): lots",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (16:58): like, search engines",
        "34b0d246331696992e9ee7235f88ca66 (17:02): sure, there are a few decent libraries around and if you spend a lot of time and effort on it, you can do a somewhat decent job",
        "34b0d246331696992e9ee7235f88ca66 (17:02): but parsing xml is trivial, and implemented in every language around",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (17:03): ok so for my dialog structure shall I just use &lt;p&gt; and classes ?",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (17:03): &lt;p class=&quot;person&quot;&gt;Alicia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that...&lt;/p&gt;",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (17:04): something like this",
        "ff88150f5a310bf3162acf6d05a6d8bf (17:04): you can use whatever you like. If your data is not an information repository (say, transcripts or historical conversation) semantic markup is just sugar coating.",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:05): it's nice if you use it for people who do care about semantic markup, but if you're just going to be presenting a bunch of conversation that will never really be used as source data for information extraction, go with what's most comfortable for you to write",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:05): and understand.",
        "e9596197bcf2219b77d5e26538dbcc62 (17:07): 1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd: what 0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b and other dude said",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:07): also be aware that the &lt;dialog&gt; element *adds* code, it doesn't really replace it.",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (17:07): semantic is important in the sens that it as to be searchable but I use rdfa for this",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:07): you're now marking up who-said-it with &lt;dt&gt; and what-said-thems with &lt;dd&gt;",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:08): 1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd, EVERY search engine already figured out excellent information extraction algorithms before HTML5 was a thinkle in the collective web's eye =)",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (17:09): 0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b, I meant searchable within my own  system because I want to be able to aggreate every section where let say a person speaks",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (17:09): (that's another question anyway)",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:09): then the choice is obvious.",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:10): it's not even a question what to you, if you have your own system, and you want to do semantic extraction, you add as much markup as is required to make information extraction efficient.",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:10): (and then you use a side by side indexer like Lucene or what-have-you to periodically index modified content)",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (17:11): 0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b, cool, nice to see how people relaxed about html semantic",
        "1dd4463be09f026075ed4d2dcdefe8dd (17:12): I still remember the (not so) old times when it was *wrong* to not validate",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:12): it is wrong not to validate, if you want to publish on the internet",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:12): but if you can't validate because &quot;the spec is too new&quot;, then you validate the parts that you can.",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:13): a lot of the HTML5 spec, in terms of elements, is stable, and can be validated.",
        "0de37da1d654c10aed33d7b7347b8e3b (17:14): so even though w3c says html5 validation is experimental, it'll typically have you covered.",
        "187e420329b75d30372f4309323329bf (17:22): Is there any standard shim for getComputedStyle in old IEs?",
        "187e420329b75d30372f4309323329bf (17:22): I find one on javascriptkit.com that's very wrong",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (17:32): hey guys",

        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (17:32): and I have a question",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (17:32): can My cache manifest point to other cache manifests?",
        "450443be80cec5189f89c56219105d41 (17:33): wait, i dont know if my quersiton makes sense",

        "187e420329b75d30372f4309323329bf (17:52): Just in case anyone needs it, I made a shim for getComputedStyle().getCssPropertyValue() in old IEs",
