Right. It's a legitimate question. He talked to us for more than 40 minutes, several times he asked, are the police outside? Am I going to get arrested?

It is reality.  \nSpeaker 4    00:41:21    Do teens let strangers into their online world? In a survey conducted by the intelligence group, Dateline questioned 500 teenagers across the country, ages 14 to 18 about their computer habits. When asked if they chat online to people they've never met before. An overwhelming majority said yes. Whether it's all the time, sometimes or not. Very often when asked of someone they've met online, has wanted to meet them in person, 58% said yes. And 29% said they had a scary experience online. What about personal information tools? A predator can use like a name, a picture, an address, a birthday. When asked if they talk about personal information on the internet, about half a teen said yes they do. We also asked if they did things online they would not want their parents to know about. Again, about half said yes. More than 90% told us that they were responsible when they used the computer. But what about friends, classmates, other teams? The answer a big no. Most said other teens are not behaving responsibly online, which should be a red flag to parents.  \nSpeaker 30    00:42:35    Where are you at?  \nSpeaker 4    00:42:37    And that brings us back to the parade of suspected predators in Ohio. Next week we'll return to the heartland. What's going to happen when some of the men you've seen tonight appear in court?  \nSpeaker 31    00:42:48    The maximum penalty, uh, is up to 12 months in prison.  \nSpeaker 2    00:42:51    Hey,  \nSpeaker 4    00:42:51    Come on in.
