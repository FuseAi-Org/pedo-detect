        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (22:00): that doesn't seem to be appropriate to a #html",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (22:00): that would depend entirely on how you are coding things server side.",

        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (22:31): that's because text-align centre is not to be used on block elements",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (22:31): it is actually a bug in IE",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (22:31): won't align in any other browser",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (22:31): add margin: auto;",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (22:31): to center correctly",

        "83292dea979a96bc5146890be59ccf86 (22:32): nemo_work, i added  margin: 0 auto; to the body and still got the same results",
        "83292dea979a96bc5146890be59ccf86 (22:32): the page is not beig centered",

        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (22:33): anyway, the text-align thing still holds true",

        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:10): i just wanted to ask if there are any  weblogs completely written in HTML?",
        "9621eb291fb98ba098685ed872b8cf9a (23:11): alnokta: sure there are",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:12): as opposed to written in...",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:12): really? i mean like pivot which is written totally in PHP without the need for mysql",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:12): ah. you have some curious requrements",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:12): by HTML you mean PHP - mysql?",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:12): nope....",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:12): you mean just a flat HTML page?",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:13): that *was* how web pages used to be written ;)",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:13): yep",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:13): alnokta: you could take any weblog I imagine, and save as HTML complete in firefox and hey presto, have an HTML version :-p",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:14): haha . funny",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:14): well, your question kinda warrants silly answers. :)",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:15): why? make the database flat ... submission form to add entries.. then add links to index...",
        "235c7d16517a3d035bebf1003975a024 (23:15): and how do you add the entries?",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:16): yeah. no kidding, if not using PHP, what magically handles the form?",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:16): thats the problem ...",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:16): yeah, you're asking a nonsensical question",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:16): thus, you get nonsensical answers",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:16): may be add a little flash",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:16): GIGO",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:16): flash is client side",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:17): you still have that issue. the only tools you can work with client side are the browser's",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:17): there is a fundamental perceptual disconnect going on here :)",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:19): so i guess i will stick to pivot ... what about xml?",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:26): alnokta: what about it?",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:27): nevermind i was wrong...",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:27): alnokta: btw, kinda teasing about it, but it is totally possible to visualise a server tool that when provided input, would update an HTML page, that tool could be sent commands in some terse format.  rather stupid way to go about things, though",
        "1ed63740b62505736586b09814ca7ea9 (23:28): and you'd still have to figure out what to write the server tool in :)",
        "7e04baf78e9ab2dad0aec077b3f8b197 (23:30): yes",
        "a1c396b4ab80c306e956fb4223aed547 (23:30): hello",
