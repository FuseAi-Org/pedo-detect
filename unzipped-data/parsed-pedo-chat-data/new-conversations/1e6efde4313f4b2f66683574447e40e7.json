        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:41): my own feelings on the subject:",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:41): -1 on +1",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:41): 0?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:41): or do you mean -1 over +1, as in -1/+1, which is -1?",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (02:41): deletes some codec discussion",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:42): so what would you guys think of turning &quot;Mostly Semantic Markup&quot; into &quot;Separation Of Concerns&quot;",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:42): that might capture the real point better, in addition to placating Murray (though I am not sure I get his point still)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:42): without changing the text of the principle?",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:43): well, with light editing to match the new name",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:43): sure",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:43): Enable Separation Of Presentation From Content would be a bit unwieldy",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (02:44): agrees with 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e that at some point the group needs to decide on by-argument versus by-majority",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:44): i find it quite amusing given that HTML5 currently very carefully sidesteps the &lt;b&gt;/&lt;i&gt; issue by defining them semantically without breaking their presentational meaning",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:44): avoid talking about Behaviour",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:44): nobody knows what that is",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:45): It's :hover",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (02:45): everything that involves events...",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (02:45): but then &lt;a&gt; would violate it so nm",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:45): i rest my case (you both gave totally different answers)",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:46): I just bring up :hover whenever the case comes up because CSS fanatics don't seem to mind it even though they cry about separating out behavior",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:46): some css fanatics",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:47): i personally think all the discussion about &quot;separating behaviour&quot; is one by red herring",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:50): anyone able to find text in HTML4 that says you should ignore &lt;td&gt; tags when they're not in a &lt;table&gt;?",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:51): by-argument invites the question of who decides what arguments are best",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:52): I would say the person responsible for taking action (most likely the editor of a relevant spec) should make the initial decision",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:52): and for lack of a better policy, vote of the group can override if someone calls for one",

        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (02:53): wonders why Murray is so hung up on +1 and -1",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:53): votes would hopefully also be preceded by reasoned discussion",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:55): the problem with votes (not that i oppose them, just mentioning this) is that if the person making the decision hasn't yet made a new decision based on new arguments, but made a decision on old arguments, the vote can force the issue before the new arguments are considered",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (02:55): 139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884: what I tried to get at Re: semantics was that defining reasonable presentation for different media is good enough and precise semantics aren't that important",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:55): e.g. i have thousands of outstanding comments on HTML5 still to deal with, all of which have so far been &quot;ignored&quot;, and people who raised them might think that i'm ignoring their feedback, and so might want to raise a vote",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:56): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: I think different people have different exact views on this matter, and it's kind of hard to capture",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:56): I think what we want to express is that HTML isn't gonna be XSL-FO, but we're not overly dogmatic about semantics",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (02:57): we don't want to repeat HTML 3.2 either i think",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (02:57): (although the focus HTML 3.2 had on implementors was prolly good)",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (02:57): nor become DocBook or TEI",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:58): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: like saying &quot;this month we will mostly discuss media elements, next two weeks after will be canvas&quot; or something along those lines",

        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (02:58): obviously people can make a comment any time they want but should have less expectation of active discussion when it's not one of the focus topics",
        "62e1e89124794c1ee4b8ec5965cfb90e (02:59): that kind of schedule would be awesome",
        "e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0 (02:59): yeah, it would be useful if 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e put his rough agenda somewhere in the draft again I think",
        "62e1e89124794c1ee4b8ec5965cfb90e (02:59): but it assumes that there's some definitive list of issues to go through",
