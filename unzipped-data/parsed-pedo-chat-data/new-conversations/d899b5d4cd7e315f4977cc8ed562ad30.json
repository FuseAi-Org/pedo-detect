        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:18): huh. the way you added the note made me interpret &quot;same input&quot; differently.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:19): That just means you have to define &quot;same input&quot; more precisely. ^^_",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:19): indeed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:19): i hadn't realised that might have been a source of the confusion",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:19): I'll cancel the email I was about to send and let you correct yourself.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:19): heh",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (23:20): Did we settle on @alt?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:21): No, I'm still talking with one of our internal teams.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:21): Dude, it's been less than 24 hours.  ^_^",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:38): &quot;I do not think a tautology machine would be a meaningful fulfillment of this success criterion.&quot;",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:38): We should ask the tautology machine for confirmation.",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:46): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: I said that weeks ago!",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:46): did it become relevant again all of a sudden?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:46): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, yes, I'm catching up.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:46): No, I just started reading the backlog.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:47): Got totally messed up by Passover.  250ish spec mails and &gt;500 MediaWiki commit mails.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:50): what happened to the wiki",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:52): Hmm.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:52): hey, there's a mediawiki person here! how convenient :-P",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:52): any idea what i should do?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:53): I have shell access as the wiki user, so, I'm looking.  :P",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:53): (someone gave it to me, can't remember who)",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:53): Looks like a DB problem to me, not a MW problem.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:53): But let me see.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:53): well you have access to the db too if you have access to the shell :-P",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:53): Yep.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:53): time for me to start changing passwords i guess :-P",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:54): (i'm fine with you having access, but, um, people, please let me know who you give access to :-P )",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:54): Interesting.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:55): Maybe it is a MediaWiki problem.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:55): Let me see if setting $wgCacheDirectory fixes it.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:56): i hope it was Lachy_ who gave you access",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:57): There we go, fixed.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:57): Apparently the new localization cache system isn't too reliable if you use a database backend.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:57): good to know",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:57): It's meant to use a filesystem-based cache, I think CDB or something.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:58): You can chown /home/whatwikiuser/wikicache to be webserver-writable but not world-writable, if you like (I just set 777).",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:58): (since, obviously, I can't do anything else)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:00): the server runs as the user",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:00): Okay.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:01): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:01): should do anyway",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:01): Yeah, I see that now.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:05): thanks for fixing it btw! much appreciated",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (00:05): dunno what i would have done :-P",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:05): You could have asked for help in #mediawiki!",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (00:05): (although you probably wouldn't be running unreleased versions, so you probably wouldn't have hit the problem)"
