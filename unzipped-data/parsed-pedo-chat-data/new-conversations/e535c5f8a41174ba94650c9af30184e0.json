        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:22): gah, &quot;hg&quot; needed to download the latest source version? what happened to the good old svn days :(",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:25): The good old svn days turned into the better new hg days",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:26): It's basically the same as SVN except you use the command &quot;hg&quot; instead of &quot;svn&quot; :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:26): ...although I suppose it might be a bit more painful on Windows",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:35): well, not really, seems to work exactly like it should",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:37): hmm... strange, it checked out the whole tree, even though I requested a subdirectory",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:41): hmm... &quot;... you cannot check out only one directory of a repository&quot;",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:47): hmm... I guess I can't clone the default repository and use that? seems that is 0.11 still. Maybe the 0.2 branch? *figures out how to clone a branch*",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:51): is that the latest version? or should I look into some other branch?",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:54): ah, fuck it, beautifulsoup seems deprecated anyways",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:55): dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff: Yeah, Hg doesn't support partial checkouts - you just clone the entire repository",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:55): yeah, I figured that out",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:55): which includes all the branches and everything",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:55): ah",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:56): how do I know which the latest branch is?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:56): You should just use the default branch",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:56): ok",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:56): since the others were for temporary experiments",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:57): I think the BS code is still included and should work better than the 0.11 release, though I could be wrong about that",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:58): seems I still get the same error there",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:58): but there are fundamental problems in BS that mean it can't work properly in html5lib, and nobody has been interested in spending a great deal of effort on it",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:58): but with an extra DataLossWarning",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (13:58): I'll just use something else then I guess",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:59): Okay, so maybe it doesn't work much better than the 0.11 release :-(",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:00): lxml is usually the recommended treebuilder",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (14:01): ok, i saw the remark in the docs about lxml being an &quot;excellent library&quot; :)",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (14:01): or something in those terms",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (14:08): oh great, the lxml parser crashes on those sites too :(",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:08): Hmm, seems to work okay for me with lxml",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:09): (I can't test BS yet since I don't have it installed)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:10): No, because that timed out when I first tried downloading it",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:10): but now I see the problem :-/",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:12): ihatexml.py lives up to its name",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (14:12): heh, great name for a file, what does it do?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:15): http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/issues/detail?id=125",
        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (14:15): ah, that seems it",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:15): It tries to modify the names returned by the HTML parser so they're compatible with APIs that enforce XML's name requirements",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:16): (and similar things)",

        "dbc957b8ae41419e5e3f1d3b6d3842ff (14:21): heh, I can understand that",
