        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:01): the trick is to get folks to agree with the basic premise underlying all",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:02): I think that if we acknowledge that browser makers have to render existing material, and that spec organizations have two roles:",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:03): ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc: i was saying that as a suggestion to split the &quot;pave the cowpaths&quot; principle in three",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:03): providing guidance to browser makers so that authors don't need to write code four times AND providing guidance to authors so that best practices start to emerge",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:03): then there may not be any disagreement",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:04): i was just talking about the author side",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:05): I think most of why people object to supporting existing content is that it sounds like bad grammar is being mandated -- it isn't",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:06): the browser folks just want to preserve what already exists without breaking it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:06): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:06): is aware :-)",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:06): a good authoring document from W3C could just resolve the dispute (it seems to me -- completely naively of course)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:07): yeah... we just need someone to volunteer to write it",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (07:08): we do have volunteers to write authoring guidelines / tutorials based on the specs, though none who have actually started yet",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (07:08): ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc: see, I don't believe in bad grammar",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:09): I would never have thought you to have :)",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:09): oh ick that sounds awful",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:10): Murray seems to have accepted Dan's nomination and he seems to be qualified",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:10): imho there is only one qualification that is needed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:10): and that is having already started",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:10): :-)",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:11): it is just a matter of getting the ball rolling and convincing folks it is rolling in the right direction",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:11): If there is confidence that bad grammar is not being mandated, then alot of the suspicion may evaporate",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:12): I know it isn't being mandated -- you guys tell us it isn't -- Maybe a good solid promisory note that it won't be will be enough",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:13): s/isory/issory/",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:14): I have a sense that the WG will eventually sort of coalesce",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:15): but that the oddball harmonics of third generation dispute will reverberate for a few years",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:16): i thought we'd already resolved that particular issue actually",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:17): That would be nice -- I thought people just got sidetracked by new stuff and by Dan's prohibition on the topic for a while",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:18): it seemed to me that the same issue rather mutated into a new guise",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:18): maybe",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:18): i guess we'll see when the group does real work",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:19): That is clearly what Dan is encouraging",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:19): It's amazing that WHATWG is still getting work done -- my hat is off to all of you",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:20): the competition isn't going to stand still while we do our little w3c politicking... we can't afford to not get work done",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:23): The people who have been doing WHATWG for a long time do have a big advantage over the rest of us --",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:23): I got knee deep in some document.write test cases I was trying to figure out during the last week",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:24): and found myself getting confused about specs and browsers and what a test case would show",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (07:24): the internets are hard",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:25): they are - - mind bogglingly so",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (07:27): well  -- it is late in my part of the country -- so will have to sign off -- take a look at the dash-stroke cases I put in WHATWG -- some are quite cute",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (07:27): Writing tests is a good way to hit all the complex bits that are specified or implemented wrongly :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:27): nn",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (07:27): dashed strokes are kind of useful for charts, if that becomes a more popular use for &lt;canvas&gt; it might be worth speccing them",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (07:27): Not good for minimising confusion, though",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (07:27): but detailing how the dash pattern works is a pain",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:28): yeah i imagine dashes will be a v3 or v4 feature"
