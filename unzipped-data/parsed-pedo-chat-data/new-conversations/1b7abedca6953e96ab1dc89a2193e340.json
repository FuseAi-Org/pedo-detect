        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:37): work related?",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:37): yup",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:37): the best kind",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:37): no no no, wait for it",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:37): so... my boss thinks that Froogle is the be-all-end-all",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:38): and we spend 10% of our revenue on advertising - mostly Google Adwords",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:38): so my roommate wrote this app for them when he was working there that does feeds for various services - one of which was Froogle",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:38): I wasn't running it often enough, so they gave it to my co-worker, who has nothing better to do",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:39): so, the president calls &quot;oh shit oh shit oh shit we're not on froogle&quot;",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:39): so my boss calls &quot;oh shit, we're not on froogle. Neither is your stuff&quot;",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:39): so I post him the links for my stuff and tell him to stop smoking crack, and to go log into Base for my co-worker's stuff",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:39): apparently my co-worker didn't get a base account",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:39): heh",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:39): he's been FTP'ing it to Hedwig (Froogle server)",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:40): which, by the way, rejects all old logins",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:40): so as a result, my boss had to go create a Base login, and try and manipulate some data from the feedloader - because he's not smart enough to fix Feedloader itself",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:40): so he uploads a XLS file, because he STILL doesn't understand XLS is binary, and renaming it to .csv DOESN'T WORK",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:40): haha",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:41): and so he's telling me the description doesn't match",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:41): what doesn't it match? he doesn't know",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:41): so now I need to run the feed, then convert it to another data format, then run it through my tool which correctly creates froogle feeds",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:41): then do the bulk upload again",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:41): except... Base emails all results out",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:41): and he used his work email",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:42): ha",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:42): I need popcorn, this just gets better and better",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:42): so... uh, I guess I'm retooling my php script to make it take data from any source instead of processing a query",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:42): you know, I'm going to write him a nice little perl script",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:42): and simultainiously teach myself perl",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:43): chaka: &quot;feed status: disapproved&quot; details showed that the upload &quot;failed&quot;",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:43): help says: &quot;hey numbnuts, TSV files aren't binary&quot;",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:43): whoops.",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:43): haha",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:43): yeah, I love that renaming XLS to CSV",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:43): thats hot",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:44): chaka: well, I built a tool that does UPC lookups",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:44): it takes a CSV and does a whole bunch of stuff",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:44): so, I gave it to the president, who renamed his XLS file .CSV because my boss told him to (my boss is the head of IT)",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:44): so I told my boss very specifically not to do that, and he asked why not. After telling him 3 times I explained that binary != ascii",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:44): and he said &quot;yes it does&quot;",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:44): &quot;you can do that&quot;",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:45): so, apparently renaming files can totally transform the contents, especially if you're using Windows XP CRACKSMOKER EDITION",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:45): your boss is the kind of guy Microsoft is targetting with Vista",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:45): with big red buttons and cool effects",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:45): although, come to think of it, that sounds like an interesting idea... transformations at the OS based on extensions",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:45): you could provide filters",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:45): ooh",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:45): chaka: write that down and give it to your boss",

        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:46): Kog, actually, I patented that string as soon as freenode sent it my way, so you owe me money",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:46): chaka: eat shit and die capitalist pig",
        "f676d6f993d218c809593f02705afc80 (06:47): Kog: Then you'd have peopel going &quot;Why doesn't renaming it change the contents on Linux? It does it on YourOSNameHere...&quot;",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:47): Kog, sortof an inside joke.  Every FTE here has atleast one patent plaque",
        "2d0007bc5ad11988d4b3d019fe2fecbd (06:47): extensions must die",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:47): chaka: I doubt that",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:47): chaka: there are 300,000 employees",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:47): Kog, I'd take pictures for you as proof, but I don't want to get fired :p",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:49): Kog, let me put it another way, I've seen atleast 30 patent plaques in this building, and I've only met a small portion of people in building 10",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:49): heh, that doesn't mean every FTE has one ;)",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:49): it just means that MS loves to have patent rights",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (06:49): patently absurd ;)",
        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:49): yeah",

        "be97847377c73d525c8d6d2bc3bbc30d (06:50): frb-away, I like extensions on unix the best, when they're purely descriptive",
