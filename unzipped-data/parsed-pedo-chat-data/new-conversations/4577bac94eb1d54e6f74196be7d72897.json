        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:43): 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: i assume background-origin of padding-box just uses a fictional padding box that doesnt care about scrolling",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:44): term padding-box is kind of funny in that case heh",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:45): background-attachment not local is the 2.1 case",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:45): right",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:45): why do we need a fictional padding box?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:45): isn't following",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:45): asking how that interacts with background-clip/origin of padding-box",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:45): well let's say you have an overflow:auto div",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:45): and the border box is 300x300",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:45): but the padding box scrolls",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:45): so it is 1000x1000",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:46): then the background is attached to the viewport",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:46): so it doesn't scroll",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:46): in the !local case",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:46): it's just fixed to the border, as it were",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:46): yes, but what does that mean when used with clip/origin of padding/content",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:46): well the viewport is inside the paddng box",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:47): so padding-box is not an issue",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:47): origin content-box might be",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:47): hm",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:47): ok it's obvious you don't  really use the padding-box in 2.1",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:47): it's just a synthetic padding-box",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:47): inside the border",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:47): totally ignoring the scrolling",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:47): which is fine but not really spelled out",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:48): ok, yeah, so you have two conceptual padding boxes",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:48): the one inside the viewport",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:48): and the one outside the viewport",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:48): they coincide when there's no scrolling",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:48): right",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:48): it makes sense here to use the outer padding-box when you're attached to the border",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:48): and the inner padding box when you're attached to the content (i.e. local)",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:48): right",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:49): i think the spec should probably clarify this",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:49): content-box has the same issue",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:49): ok",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:49): yeah",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:49): two conceptual content boxes",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:49): border-box has the opposite issue",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (00:49): right which you addressed by stating you could just clip",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:49): and the spec says what to do there",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:50): yeah, I guess you have to create a conceptual content box that's fixed to the border-box",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:50): and position wrt that",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:50): good catch",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:50): I'll add some text for it",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (00:50): wonders what Mozilla does",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:06): ok background-clip, background-origin in webkit now with prefixes dropped and final syntax",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:06): woot",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:06): 3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d: pedantic nitpick",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:06): &quot;The difference between \u201a\u00c4\u00f2scroll\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and \u201a\u00c4\u00f2local\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is only visible when the element has a scrolling mechanism: &quot;",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:07): technically you can set the scrollLeft/Top of overflow:hidden element",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:07): s",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:07): there is no visible scrolling mechanism necessarily in that case",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:07): but probably not worth bothering with correcting i guess",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:08): actually maybe it is worth correcting",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:08): since basically overflow:hidden + background-attachment:local will need to clip to padding box",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:09): it's kind of weird that if the contents of the element don't scroll that you might not clip",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:09): but then if you suddenly do scroll that you'd suddenly start clipping",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:10): i'm thinking of overflow:auto",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:10): &quot;The UA may, however, treat the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2border-box\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 value of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2background-clip\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 as \u201a\u00c4\u00f2padding-box\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 in cases where \u201a\u00c4\u00f2background-attachment\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is \u201a\u00c4\u00f2local\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and the contents of the element scroll.&quot;",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:10): seems like even if the contents of the element don't scroll you may just want to always use padding-box",
        "cd3e478e1fb92aef95961d138529f52c (01:10): since otherwise as scrollbars come and go your backgroudn would jump in and out of the border",
