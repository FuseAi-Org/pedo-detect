        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:07): can't remember how to simplify logs",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:08): does ln|x-2| - ln|x+2| = ln|(x-2)(x+2)| or not?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:10): is just being stupid",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:11): No",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:11): ln|(x-2)/(x+2)|, I think",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:11): looks at marking scheme and sees he's made another mistake",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:11): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: That's still wrong because it's a modulo function, IIRC",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:12): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: Oh, you mean |x-2| like abs(x-2) and not just fancy brackets?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:12): In that case you'd want to calculate separate solutions for x &lt;= -2, -2 &lt; x &lt;= 2, and 2 &lt; x",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:17): I also realized I didn't actually need to simplify it",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:17): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: yes",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:18): annevk: http://philip.html5.org/data/script-with-trailing-slash.txt",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:20): fails to see how \\frac{x^2}{x^2-4} = 1 + \\frac{4}{x^2-4}",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:21): sees now",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:21): wonders how we're meant to realize that",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:21): (x^2)/(x^2-4) = (x^2-4+4)/(x^2-4) = 1 + 4/(x^2-4)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:22): It's just a standard way of rearranging fractions :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:22): Try to add stuff to the top so it looks like the bottom, and then things cancel out nicely",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:23): Yeah, I saw that",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:23): It's just a question of how we are meant to realize that",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:23): I guess we're meant to think that x = y + 4 and work out that y = x^2-4",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:24): You're meant to have done some maths in the past, so you can recognise that in this kind of case you can simplify by adding stuff to the top so it looks like the bottom :-)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (19:25): You see there's a 1, so you try to make a 1 on the left side too, and it just works out. :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:25): It's just an instance of a/(a+b) = (a+b-b)/(a+b) = 1+b/(a+b), which is a simplification if b is simpler than a",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:26): Uh, 1-b/(a+b)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:32): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: Yeah, sure, but I haven't done maths in weeks :P",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:47): finds it strange that the BBC iPlayer appears to have the rights to stream some movies but [this is wild speculation] not to display screenshots of them on the web site, so the poster frames are unrelated images of the principal actor",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:48): (e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b009lt62/The_Magic_Roundabout/ and http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00gbjh8/Dances_with_Wolves/)",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:51): annevk, oops, I meant: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/whatwg-blog/",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:52): unrelatedly notices that a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d's latest blog post breaks Opera's feed reader, because Opera scrolls horizontally to the end of the &quot;java -classpath ...&quot; line and does not display horizontal scrollbars and so the rest of the post disappears off the left edge of the screen",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:54): really threw himself a the hard end of stuff going straight into previous exam qustions",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:55): jgraham, good to know. :)",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (19:58): You mean you can break Opera with something as simple as a &lt;pre&gt;?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:59): a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d: It appears so",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:00): a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d: (though it's only showing a single feed entry at a time, so you can only break your own and can't interfere with anyone else's)",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (20:03): it seems Opera 9 uses ul { margin: 1em 0; } when a &lt;ul&gt; is inside a &lt;dd&gt; whereas Firefox and IE have a rule like dl ul { margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; }",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (20:04): (Fx and IE are what I expected)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:11): 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: Would you mind if I said I thought that blog design looked quite ugly? :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:12): Actually I think it's just the green that I don't like much, mainly the blockquotes",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:13): If I remove the colours and indent them more then it looks better to me - the green box is just a bit weird",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:16): Also the green horizontal lines are a kind of sickly colour - if I make them something like 2px #ddf then it makes me happier",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (20:17): Other than that, it looks fine to me :-)",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (20:18): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, I just copied the colours from the spec. feel free to put your own demos online",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (20:38): jgraham, updated the table inspector UI demo: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/table-inspector/new"
