        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (19:36): hay",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:37): wich antenna should i use, i have computers on my home in the down side of the antenna like 5 meters down and i have a client 20 meters out of my house in the same line of the antenna height and another client 60 meters in the opposite direction.",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:37): wich antenna would fit well for this case?",
        "b3ac137cc76957b079ca2a432978c49b (19:39): separate indoor &amp; outdoor antennas, if you can manage it",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:39): well",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:39): how could i do that ?",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:39): using some kind of splitter?",
        "b3ac137cc76957b079ca2a432978c49b (19:40): otherwise probably a medium-gain omni, ~ 7-9dB or so?  Too much gain flattens the pattern vertically, and would cut off your lower-elevation site",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:40): also on a WRT54GS i can point both TX/RX signal to just one antenna connector right ?",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:40): i thinked of a 8dbi antenna",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:40): but im not that sure hehe",
        "b3ac137cc76957b079ca2a432978c49b (19:41): WiredBoy: yup.  It'd be nice of there was software support for switching antennas on the fly, depending on which station it was talking to",
        "b3ac137cc76957b079ca2a432978c49b (19:41): but you can at least lock it onto one fulltime",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:43): so i can lock the tx/rx signal in just one side of my antennas?",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (19:43): like right or left connector?",
        "b3ac137cc76957b079ca2a432978c49b (19:44): WiredBoy: yeah.  Even the stock firmware supports that",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (19:45): chromatid, it does switch antennas on the fly, depending on the station",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (19:45): that's basically what diversity antennas are",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (19:45): the one with the stronger signal gets used",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:01): cool",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:01): so i can use my wrt54gs for outdoor applications",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:01): :-)",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:01): wich side of it is better for it ?",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:01): Left or Right ? Looking from the front side.",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:03): also a 8dbi antenna will match for my needs so?",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:09): which version?",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:09): (of wrt)",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:09): WRT54GS V3",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:10): I think",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:11): hmm",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:11): so the best one",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:11): is left side?",
        "2a655a0e14a4584229ba4aeef43b9039 (20:11): /dev/null&quot;)",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:29): :o",

        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:42): anyone home?",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:43): nope.",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:44): it took me half an hour to get back on, I just set it up a few days ago and it hasn't managed to stay on for more than a day",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:45): what gear are you using?",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:45): and have you tried updating all the firmware?",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:45): netgear",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:45): yeah",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:45): ?",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:45): will a 8dbi omni cover my area well?",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:45): WiredBoy, there's no real way to tell without trying it",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:45): because i think 15? is still not much vertical coverage",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:46): I'm using the WG111 usb adapter and the WGR614 wireless router",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:46): maybe 4 sectorial antennas would work better?",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:46): like 4 90? 12dbi sectorial antennas?",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:46): 4 sectorals will certainly work better. You'll need 4 radios of course.",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:46): with 40? Degrees of vertical coverage?",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:46): you can use a splitter",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:47): sure you can.",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:47): and a booster maybe",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:47): well, then you lose all the power",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:47): just try the 8db omni and see if it works",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:47): remember, amps amplify everything, including noise",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:47): the s/n doesn't change with an amp, if anything, it gets worse",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:47): no point in getting something complicated if the simple stuff works",
        "776833c15e61c1feac12e570742b7258 (20:47): exactly",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:47): the problem is that ill have to bought the 8dbi antenna",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:48): well, you can return it...",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:48): not really hehe :[",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:48): each sectorial needs like 32mw each ?",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:48): Elisabeth, it could, but I'd try changing the usb wifi adapter first",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:49): ok",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:49): :)",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:49): linux or windows, btw?",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:50): windows",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:51): ah, I forgot to update the router",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (20:51): do that and see if there are still problem",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:51): I just have the adapter updated",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:52): brb",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:52): jdhutchin1 for my application i believe 6dbi would be godly...",
        "3b6019508aaf2bdb9f44dee4a9d78c8b (20:52): I won't know if there's a problem until tomorrow or something",
        "6befcf7e05cb04f195fe0467d74af4d7 (20:52): but the problem is finding a dbi antenna for outdoor lol",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (21:03): anyone know a inexpensive router off hand that can act as a ethernet to wifi bridge?",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (21:03): that's what all wifi routers do more or less",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (21:04): just use the lan side and don't do anything with the wan port",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (21:04): disable the dhcp server if you want",
        "4bb1dc72312a2e63f0e80005dafbd267 (21:04): anything that can run openwrt probaly",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (21:04): or do you want to use it as a client instead of an ap?",
        "45b6db71b233fa960b64f245180b4575 (21:04): as a client",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (21:04): ah ok",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (21:04): iirc quite a few can",

        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (21:09): it might do what you want",
        "36cf1572e3313547d71ff918326ab0d5 (21:09): but with wifi coverage, especially involving walls/obstacles, you really just have to try",
