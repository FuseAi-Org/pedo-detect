        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:14): You guys have done an amazing job.",
        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:14): we are working getting it futhers",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:15): Also, has anybody thought about taking the NTFS implementation from Linux and building a wrapper to make it an IFS driver?",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:15): That may be a good goal for port 0.3.x...",

        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:16): I think of it time to time",

        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:17): and u will lost alot speed and other stuff",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:17): Do you mean from the translation layer or just that NTFS has more overhead than FAT?",
        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:17): and windows and linux filesystem stack is alot diffent",
        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:17): the translations layers",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:18): I don't know much about the Linux kernel (at least, not these days). I am familiar with the BSD kernel architectures thoughh.",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:18): Well, it could be a gradual thing. I don't mean keep Linux file system semantics, but mimmick the Linux bio stuff in terms of IRP's until the code can slowly be changed. Thats one idea.",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:18): Or do you think ROS should have a from-scratch NTFS driver?",

        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:20): it was alot work getting them inplace",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:20): True. I think the BSD stack was a good idea though.",

        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:21): Arty have done great work with tcp/ip stack",

        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:22): it boting now",
        "2741b69c3b371bf320f870bfe5de76c7 (02:22): hmm i'll make clean",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:22): In NT there is a generic API for journalling (a bit like Linux's jbd) stuff actually in NTOSKRNL.",
        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:22): Not sure if those API's are documented.",

        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:22): u can try the iso achive",

        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:24): GL: Thats a good idea. What is the licensing of the captive stuff.... can it be integrated (legally) in ROS?",
        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:24): it comes from ros ntokrnl",
        "2741b69c3b371bf320f870bfe5de76c7 (02:24): imo the main thing that keeps us from merging captive is heavy reliance on glib",

        "b9ce391e970ede27e9eb0c3f6ef3f274 (02:25): Hmmm. So (never having looked at the captive stuff) I take it the code they implemented does not use the Rtl* stuff?",
        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:25): he implement whole adv* into ntosnkrln and ntdll",

        "6c30c79bc333fa9f0c9a01c4b03008d3 (02:26): with glib",
        "2741b69c3b371bf320f870bfe5de76c7 (02:26): which is ok considering he was going for using it in userland on linux",
