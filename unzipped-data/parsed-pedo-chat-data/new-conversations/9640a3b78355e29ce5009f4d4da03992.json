        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:03): Did we already have a discussion about the confusion that will arise when authors try to do document.createElement(&quot;svg&quot;) and expect it to work?",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (22:05): yes, we decided it was not worth the complexity of making it work",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (22:06): the right solution for now is probably to have js libraries to paper over the confusingness",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:09): Right I don't really see how you woulf make it work in general",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:09): All I can imagine is having createSVGElement and so on",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:09): Which would mean that you didn't have to remember the namespace at least",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (22:09): doug had an idea of Element.createElement",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (22:09): the SVG WG has some plan on adding a bunch of constructors I believe",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (22:10): which would use the same namespace as the element you're calling it on",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:10): Interesting",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:10): I guess that might help",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (22:11): doesn't help if you want to create a new &lt;svg&gt; root in an html document",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:11): Indeed",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:12): I guess javascript libraries can just have tagname-&gt;namspace mappings",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (22:12): which will almost-always work",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (22:13): i think we should wait and see how js libraries solve this before extending dom core",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (22:13): I sort of doubt they'll solve this on the element-level",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (22:14): JS libraries that create SVG today have more high-level functionality",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (22:15): if authors don't feel the need to solve it on the element level, we shouldn't extend dom core to solve it",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (22:35): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, you really think the way the HTML parser works is a bug?",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (22:35): kind of likes it",
        "b1b5726c973cb9e906ce1b5bb246147f (22:55): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: JSON.parse not in jQuery? it's release lag \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the development version has it: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-nightly.js",

        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (23:01): how should it work instead?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (23:03): In a way that doesn't require authors o understand XML namespaces",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (23:03): (I don 't know if we could have done better in the circumstances though)",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (23:04): ah ok",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (23:04): yeah it would've been nicer if markup had been a bit more coordinated",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:06): notes that nobody has shipped SVG in text/html and so it wouldn't be too late to change that",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (23:06): it would require changing how MathML and SVG work in XML and all",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (23:07): I'm just saying that what we have is bad",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (23:08): (and that we shouldn't use use this badness as an excuse for introducing more pervasive forms of the same badness)",
