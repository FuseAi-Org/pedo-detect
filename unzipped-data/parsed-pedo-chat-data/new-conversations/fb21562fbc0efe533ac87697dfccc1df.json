        "39ff917d30b2a8529d9e1d48c26f50df (15:22): it works similar to select from what I gather.",
        "455f807e679ebba141fbbb77416b7f14 (15:23): So then it's not possible to check when some data are written to a file ?",
        "39ff917d30b2a8529d9e1d48c26f50df (15:24): you could use a QTimer if some latency is ok.",

        "39ff917d30b2a8529d9e1d48c26f50df (15:29): how much accuracy do you need?",

        "47df498cdcfcfd15933beeb0e306cb7c (16:00): yes, you can pass nanoseconds to select()",

        "47df498cdcfcfd15933beeb0e306cb7c (16:48): You can of course communicate rather easily over any device. But not with Qt4 classes as they are. That's very plattform dependent.",
        "47df498cdcfcfd15933beeb0e306cb7c (16:49): Maybe you could create your own QIODevice to keep the interface. But you have to do system calls in the background.",
