        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:59): Pre-registration?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:00): (I guess this isn't the same as the thing where you choose six courses/universities to apply to)",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:01): this form is badly marked up and badly worded and illogical.",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:02): It's annoying when they take a mostly-understandable paper form and then migrate to an online system which doesn't work and doesn't make sense and is full of errors",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:02): (as, quite frankly, if I didn't get in for any of them, I wouldn't go to uni)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:12): (My old physics teacher was quite happy that Cambridge forces you do to Natural Sciences for a year instead of something specialised like physics, since he originally went there to do chemistry and then changed his mind)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:14): writes date in ISO8601 form, just too confuse most of his teachers and prove he will not be forced to break specs :P",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:21): and going straight into second year limits the options for outside subjects, partly as you have extra teaching of the one or two things you'll be missing from the slightly more specialist course at uni",
