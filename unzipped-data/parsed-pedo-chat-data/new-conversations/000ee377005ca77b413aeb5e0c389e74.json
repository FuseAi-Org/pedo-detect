        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (08:45): which had an &quot;add sound&quot; option",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (08:45): sadly, &quot;add&quot; means &quot;replace current custom sound&quot;, not &quot;add another custom sound&quot;",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (08:45): (there's no &quot;remove&quot;)",

        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (08:45): as a pair to 'been'",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (08:46): at which point i decided that i probably should read all of their strings...",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (08:55): woops. Yeah, once you go down one rat hole...",

        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:09): i was actually reading the thing in a &lt;textarea&gt; using the windows High Contrast Black theme (in the dark)",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:09): You know, they have these things called &quot;browsers&quot; that actually render the HTML",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:09): yeah, those are what hurt my eyes :)",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:09): hehe",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:10): all these things in italics, and strnage lines all over the place...",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:10): and fancy colors....",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:10): Well, the aim was to have a pretty spec even to distract from the fact that the content might be crap.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:12): suddenly remembers all this is being logged &gt;.&lt;",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:12): and you wonder why i don't like using irc for this stuff :)",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:12): i'm not saying that html is a bad thing... i do work on a browser after all",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:13): it's just that sometimes when you're tired and trying to review language, the last thing you want are distractions",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:13): the good thinig about html is that it can degrade to plain text",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:13): unlike some of the other formats i've dealt with of late, which make reviewing much more painful",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:13): yeah, I totally get that. I use my screen reader for proof reading.",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:13): heh",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:14): Seriously, using both audio and visual helps quite a bit (in my case at least).",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:15): People think I'm rude when I go to meeting because I always have my headset on, but that's only because I use my screen reader religiously.",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:16): Maybe I'll start carrying around a blind walking cane so people will not bother me.",
        "e29be37c2febc43a0d21a1f8efa351af (09:17): heh",
        "c5e3539121c4944f2bbe097b425ee774 (09:23): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2, any chance you would check what's up with http://dev.w3.org?",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:28): well, then we just got to wait I guess",
