        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:32): Maybe I can run it WITHOUT fans... &gt;:)",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:32): KimmoA: try to make AIRFLOW happen ;)",

        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:33): The CPU fan already does the main job...",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:33): a 1U chassis has very little convective airflow...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:33): Well... I guess.",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:33): this means that all the little chips on your mobo, expansion card, HDD etc get next to 0 airflow..",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:34): even in a low-profile desktop or thin tower there is a lot more airflow than a 1U chassis",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:34): Note: I didn't mean that I would put it in production use without fans.",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:35): The supposedly &quot;fanless&quot; Mini-ITX was all bogus.",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:35): It came with a fan and would die without it.",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (17:35): you can run any CPU without a fan so long as you make the heatsink large enough to accodate it",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:36): It seems that the larger the fan, the less annoying noise...",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (17:36): a 1U rack case however, doesn't let you do that",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (17:36): KimmoA: that's because with a larger fan you can run lower revs to achieve the same air movement",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:36): Well... I'm waiting for the midtower case to arrive. I'm gonna morph my poor 1U racky to a who-knowsU middy.",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:37): the problem with 1U chassis is that all those aux chips that are on expansion cards etc don't get air flow... you use a large number of low-flow 40mm fans :(",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:37): I snatched an 18 dB case fan. :S",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:37): I suspect that the dB value isn't that reliable...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:37): Is there a standard for measuring it?",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (17:38): db is the standard spl measurement",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:38): a lot of those 40mm fans can only push about 7cfm free air so you need a lot of them to produce a half decent airflow",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:39): Do any of you live in a house?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:39): fan dB is measured about 1m from the back of the fan.. it's a realible spl mesurement, however it does not take into consideration that your ear is more sensative to higher frequency sounds",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:39): so 18dB from a 4000rpm fan is more intrusive than 18dB from a 1300 rpm fan",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:39): Well... I can take a &quot;wooosh&quot; noise, but I hate &quot;biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIK&quot; ones.",
        "46c5b3443eb7241f44943054d7f43491 (17:40): i thought it was the other way around, your hf sensitivity got worse as you aged?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:40): yeah it does but inherently the ear is more sensative to higher freq sounds",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:41): I keep asking myself why it seems to be so hard to make a cheap, sound-proof case.",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:41): cause a soundproof chassis is a hard thing to make...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:42): Even in a server room, I would want to have as quiet as possible boxes.",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:42): In general, I hate machines that make too much noise.",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:44): lol",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:44): in a server room you can wear earplugs sod sound level, make the damn things cool!",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:44): Why not have them shut up from the beginning?",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:45): Earplugs aren't exactly nice to wear...",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:46): cause why waste resources on designing something that doesn't really serve a perpouse.. servers are locked away in a room where few people go, why spend money &amp; resources on enginering them to be quiet??",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:47): Well... because... because... :/",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:47): To improve products in general.",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:47): Surely noise level is a huge problem...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:48): I wonder if x86 will go on forever, BTW...",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:48): KimmoA: by the time you've put 30 quiet machines in a smallish space as a whole they ain't quiet anymore!",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:49): You mean that 30 &quot;humms&quot; become one big ROAR?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:49): YES ;)",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:50): Probably right, but I would guess that you simply heard more &quot;channels&quot; of &quot;humm&quot;.",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:52): disharmonios noise convolutes its self... if the machines are simlar all the fans will be puting out noise on a very narow band of frequencys..",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:52): thus you get one large convoluted 'noise' wave",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:52): :[",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:55): I'm almost thinking that I should get an UPS one day.",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:55): The power is very stable here, though.",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:56): Once, my clock radio was reset when I got home, but the server was running as always...",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:57): PSU hold-up...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:58): You mean that the PSU has a mini UPS built-in?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:58): not really..",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:58): :S",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (17:59): It has a two-second buffer of power? :)",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (17:59): it takes a time, a very short amount but a time, for the capaciters to dicharge... during this time if the power is reconnected the computer doesn't 'see' the voltage interuption...",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (18:00): more like 200ms",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:00): Hmm...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:00): Do really expensive PSUs have &quot;mini UPSes&quot; in them by any chance?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (18:01): typically the higher the wattage, and the more expencive the PSU the longer the hold-up time is...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:01): Ah.",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (18:02): a typical hold-up time for a  3+1 950W PSU is about 750ms",

        "f4b8514c7805489a5580661b656ccde7 (18:04): hi",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:04): would a sata 2 hdd work on sata 1?",
        "f4b8514c7805489a5580661b656ccde7 (18:05): I think so, SATA is backwards compatible",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:05): ok",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:05): so would sata disk work with dos or windows 98 that work with ide hdds?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (18:05): not without a bios emulation layer",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:05): hmm",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:05): ok",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:06): but then, can i run fat32 and windows xp on sata disk?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (18:06): yeah...",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (18:07): you can do anything with the disk as long as the OS can access it...",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:07): ok great",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (18:07): that is the problem, DOS/win9x often doesn't knoew how to speak to the SATA controler/drives",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:07): I recently finally got rid of my FDD. Now, the BIOS flasher wants me to insert a FLOPPY with the new ROM! The manual says nothing about alternate media. Can I somehow emulate floppies at this pre POST stage?",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:07): but the last question is, is a same capacity and same cache &amp; RPM sata hdd faster than equal ide hdd?",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:08): Kimi_Work, you could try with a bootable cd-rom...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:08): What good would a bootable CD do? The software is already entered easily, but it is only searching the FDD for ROMs...",
        "29ab387f3e01d60f009ab2484ac5f1f9 (18:09): no idea then",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:09): (&quot;EZ flash&quot; or something.)",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:10): Hehe...",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:10): &quot;Asus has a unique feature on their boards that will let you flash directly from floppy or cd, without booting into dos first. It's called EZ flash. Having no access to my floppy drive because of the buggy beta bios, I decided to use the CD that came with the motherboard and flash the BIOS version that's on it. That would be the safest, surest working option, right? Wrong!. Flashing went as planned (I'ld even say it went surprisingly well), but",
        "acf77e144ea894e5bbaf2530306a4e4c (18:10): unfortunately the machine would not boot, not beep, not do anything...&quot;",
