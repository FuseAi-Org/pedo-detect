        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:13): does anyone else find it ironic that with the moratorium on discussing spec splitting still in effect, we're instead having a meta discussion about the moratorium itself?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:13): I wonder how that's any better",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:13): what's the moratorium about again?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:13): i mean, what can't we talk about?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:14): it's about why we should or should not split the spec into language vs. implementation specs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:14): oh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:14): i wish i knew why anyone would want to do that and what it would actually mean",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:15): and why they've never asked for it for any other spec...",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:15): anyway",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:15): such a split would be silly",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:15): because those who've asked for it are used to specs like HTML4, XHTML1 and XHTML2, which only specificy the conforming language",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:15): that's not accurate",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:16): well, it's a rough approximation",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:16): HTML4 and XHTML2 define the language and the error handling and the processing requirements",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (02:16): maybe a little",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:16): (it's just that they do so in a woefully inadequate manner)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:17): (for both the language and the processing requirements)",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (02:34): wouldn't XHTML2's error handling be mostly defined by the XML-ness of it?",
        "8b7a61a6e9bd5b8977b7b3f02a425adc (02:34): or lack of error handling as the case may be",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (02:36): there's lots of possible errors other than syntax-level errors",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:07): you're being rather cryptic today",

You might not agree with that because you are in your own browser box (not a reproach).",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:10): If Roy picked an attribute that was actually conforming, like for instance, the target attribute, he may have a point.  Its definition isn't the easiest to understand from a web developer's perspective.",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:14): yeah. It wouldn't hurt to have non-normative, explanatory descriptions of what attributes mean or what function they perform",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:16): yeah. For some attributes, it's not too bad actually. Like the seamless attribute description is quite good, as are the width and height attributes.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (03:17): well, perhaps it could be normative. Those 3 attrs have normative descriptions",
