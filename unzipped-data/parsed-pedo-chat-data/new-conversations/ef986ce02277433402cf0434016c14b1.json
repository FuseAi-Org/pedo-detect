        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (17:20): ability to comment on the spec should simply forward people to bugzilla, ideally with some fields filled in.",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (17:22): problem with that is, they need to set up an account to actually be able to submit the bug",
        "9bb295af93051e68de66b2bd517b2e24 (17:22): or maybe a small confirm dialog the first time you do it",

        "9bb295af93051e68de66b2bd517b2e24 (17:25): yeah, we should probably give it a few weeks",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (17:25): liked the notification :-(",
        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (17:26): too",

        "587bf8b858e15d03428e1415c33c38ef (17:34): that seems to get more than notices of new bugs",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:34): public-html often gets more than just new bug notices too, though I'm not sure why",
