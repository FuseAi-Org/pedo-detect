        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (07:55): definitely a lot better than having the default",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (08:04): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, setAttribute behaves differently in HTML and XML, dataset is defined in terms of setAttribute and does not do anything with the string beforehand (e.g. lowercasing)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:04): dataset isn't defined in terms of setAttribute.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:04): (well, except for the exception stuff)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:04): (but that's unrelated to what we're talking about here)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (08:05): ah, that's confusing",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:07): it is?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:07): why is it conusing",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:07): what is confusing",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:07): i'm confused.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (08:08): the &quot;If setAttribute() would have raised an exception when setting an attribute with the name name, then this must raise the same exception.&quot; made me think the algorithm was the same as for setAttribute...",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:09): it would have said so if it was",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:09): :-)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (08:09): true",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (08:10): hopefully DOM core defines an abstract way of setting an attribute that we could use &lt;&lt; zcorpan",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (08:10): that would also avoid potential confusion if setAttribute was prototyped or something like that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:11): that would be nice",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:17): i worked out why that guy used such long paragraphs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:17): he in fact broke his paragraphs as much as he could",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:17): it's just that some of his sentences were very long",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (08:56): I think we're planning on doing it too",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (08:57): Maybe not when we first publicly release our &lt;video&gt; impl though",

        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (08:59): is surprised",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (08:59): does that mean safari is still the only release browser with &lt;video&gt; support?",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (09:10): well, I'm pretty sure, unless Firefox 3.1 is final now...",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (09:19): or maybe I'm doing soemthing wrong",
