        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:51): what counts as &quot;dangerous&quot;?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:52): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: stuff that would allow script to run in the wrong origin when the markup is inserted into a different-origin doc",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:52): oh, and style is a special case, of course",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:53): is srcdoc in a different origin by default?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:53): if the attacker can control all the attributes on an iframe element, then srcdoc is indeed dangerous",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:53): src is excluded already as it contains a URL",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:53): any attribute that takes a URL and happens to contain a javascript: URL is probably dangerous",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:53): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: what's the attack?",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:54): srcdoc can be in a unique origin if you sandbox the iframe",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (16:55): but srcdoc iframes can be same-origin with the parent and can run script",

        "e83147fdd1c7a8c2b85b2d842011b173 (16:56): Bruce: I missed the point of what a class attribute would accomplish, an input box needs more complicated data, if your have markup for that and allows that in your schema",
