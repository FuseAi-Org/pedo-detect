        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:17): hm, misspelt words is an interesting use case for &lt;u&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:17): has that ever been brought up before? i don't recall seeing it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:17): (listed in the CP for &lt;u&gt;)",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (22:18): doesn't recall seeing it",
        "8925426ae91d6282f262eb2ee108bdc0 (22:21): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, personally, I like the idea, but due to the use of INS and DEL, wouldn't a new tag such as UNS (unsure) be more appropriate? -- new name needed, but it would apply to text that may be wrong (either caught misspelling in a WYSIWYG or a piece of quoted text that was loosely quoted and may not be exact)",
        "8925426ae91d6282f262eb2ee108bdc0 (22:21): Mainly because &lt;u&gt; already has such a history of being strictly underline",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:22): i dunno, i haven't studied how common it is for web pages to indicate spelling mistakes",
        "8925426ae91d6282f262eb2ee108bdc0 (22:23): Well, I think the spelling mistakes side of the tag would be more for WYSIWYG editors, not so much the final version of the page.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:23): Like in static content, or dynamic spellchecking in text entry fields?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:23): anywhere they'd use an element, i guess",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:25): I don't think I've ever seen it in static content, except maybe when people were talking about the Word spelling/grammar checker and using it demonstratively (in which case they don't want arbitrary underline-like styling, they want the precise colour and shape that Word uses)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:26): yeah",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (22:48): yay http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/76115 (onformchange and friends)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:49): yeah, Companion Specifications is an odd name",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:49): Specs TODO",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (22:50): So, why is html5lib outputting &amp;NonBreakingSpace; instead of &amp;nbsp;?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (22:50): so does webkit's window.onerror impl support &lt;script&gt;onerror=function(){alert('woot')}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;for(;) { lol syntax error&lt;/script&gt; ?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (22:50): or just uncaught exceptions?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (22:51): 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81: because it's earlier in the entities table, maybe?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (22:51): noticed that web dom core switched from &amp;copy; to &amp;COPY; in its output",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (22:52): Yeah",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (22:52): Installing html5lib tip wasn't a good idea, apparently",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:52): I wonder how these comments work. First positive, then negative, now positive again. I guess incoming link from a positive article invites positive comments and incoming link from a negative article invites negative comments?",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (22:53): maybe html5lib should have a separate entity table for the serializer where COPY and NonBreakingSpace are not present",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (22:54): or in some other way have the serializer output nbsp and copy instead",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:54): the serializer should only need five entries",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (22:55): what if you want ascii-only and don't like NCRs?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:57): haha",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (22:57): once you get arguments like &quot;Stealing content was never easier than with HTML5&quot; you know the debate is over",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (23:01): heh http://twitter.com/tabatkins/status/30336539284209664",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (23:01): &quot;Sorry, @onchange, I wasn't talking to you. Collision of microsyntaxes!&quot;",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:02): I need XML with Namespaces so I can distinguish between @ meaning attributes and @ meaning twitter names.",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (23:04): You want curies, for the 140-char limit",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:04): With predefined prefixes.",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (23:05): In an OWL file you reference from your profile",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:08): foolip, fwiw, http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Video_type_parameters is now a &quot;Registry&quot; of some sort",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (23:08): in the sense that it is part of the &quot;Registries&quot; collection",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (23:08): hmm, apple.com uses SVG with &lt;path&gt;s as a background image for text in the navbar? boo. why don't they use real text + css text-shadow?",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (23:09): That would work in other browsers?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:09): It woudl work in Safari.  Why would they care about everyone else?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:09): (And yes, text-shadow has pretty good support.)",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (23:09): why wouldn't SVG work in other browsers?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:10): Also, 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81, we were wondering who you were this morning.  I was convinced you were a Moz employee.",
        "e83147fdd1c7a8c2b85b2d842011b173 (23:10): cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: for serialisation (expressed as xslt2 maps)  in the entities spec I omit all the aliases, so nbsp and copy win over the others, easy enough to generate a list of unique entity names from unicode.xml (basically just omit mmlalias and html5-uppercase entity sets0",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (23:10): Moz volunteer, atm",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (23:10): SVG as background images seems less widely supported than text-shadow",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (23:10): hopes that svg background image has an intrinsic height and width",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (23:10): yeah I guess that's true",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (23:10): Otherwise you earn a hardblocker, 8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 :)",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (23:10): but it's better than some -webkit thing :-)",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (23:10): because otherwise they might be hosing themselves, as no browsers implement lack of width right",
