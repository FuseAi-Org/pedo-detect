        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:47): your idea would require making sure the taint stack is always correct",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:47): that depends on how many different cases there are where a table comes off the stack",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:48): and the answer is, yeah, optimise it to a separate stack",
