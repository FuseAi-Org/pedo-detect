        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (18:58): Recently I saw a thread on Elysiun about polygonal hair (it was a girl's head with blue hair).. Can't find it anymore :( Can somebody refer me to that thread please?",

        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:10): After 3 months of harassing people, you're *still* not actually thinking about how such materials are put together and applying that analysis to your methods?",
        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (19:10): ShortWave, why would I joke? I was asking how are you doing..",
        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:11): I ignored that.",
        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:11): What I can't ignore tho, is the simple fact that you've apparently not yet learned how to analyze a material and duplicate it effectively based on your observations.",
        "5b8f9b3ba8946ecdc32802b9eb4b5cdf (19:12): and they aren't exactly hard materials to reproduce",
        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (19:13): ok",

        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:18): Pitel: IN truth, there are entire BOOKS written on the subject of texturing, both with image-based textures and procedural textures.",
        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (19:21): ShortWave, could you recommend some book please?",
        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:22): motorsep-work: I suggest you check your logs, because I'm 110% certain I've at least twice mentioned two different books on the subject to you.",
        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (19:22): ShortWave, It was about Renderman",

        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:23): Jimmey__: there's likely a compile flag somewhere",

        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:24): Jimmey__: And it's PROBABLY compile-system dependent, i.e. if you're using makefiles or Scons, etc.",
        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (19:24): ShortWave, ok",
        "5b8f9b3ba8946ecdc32802b9eb4b5cdf (19:24): leave the 386 alone unless you actually know what you are doing",
        "a2de65b279a972972e834b857b95ae2a (19:24): ShortWave, you've lost me now - I don't do much ( any ) compiling",
        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (19:25): Like when you were looking for blurred anisotropic reflections and were upset because you couldn't speed them up, which is really just a demonstration of how little you understand about the topic to begin with.",
        "a2de65b279a972972e834b857b95ae2a (19:25): timmeh, I don't mind using the 386 version, I just wondered if I could get a 686 version - If I did, would there be any benefit?",
        "5b8f9b3ba8946ecdc32802b9eb4b5cdf (19:26): Jimmey__, not with straight off the shelf compile options",
        "a2de65b279a972972e834b857b95ae2a (19:27): timmeh, 386 it is. Thanks.",
        "a69a8157963ab511bdf38662c6796081 (19:27): how would a person move a material (such as one in the sonixcarmateriallibrary.blend) to another .blend?",
        "a2de65b279a972972e834b857b95ae2a (19:28): puke2, append it. You can append a material from one .blend to another, and then select that material from the list of materials, assigning it to the object.",
        "4e034d79f6fd38d71ee4b49748485a3e (19:28): yes File Append (Shift+F1",

        "4e034d79f6fd38d71ee4b49748485a3e (19:29): browse to the .blend and browse in material directory or other...",

        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (19:34): ShortWave, you r right. I am designer, not technician :) And I have to know more about materials, I agree, more technical stuff, how it works, etc.",
        "a69a8157963ab511bdf38662c6796081 (19:35): another easy question, after you rotate an oject, how do u apply that rotation so that alt-r does not change it back?",
        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (19:36): ShortWave, but one old designer, back in time, told me, that it's not about re-inventing a bike. It's about getting all stuff that is out there already and applying it in right direction.",
        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (19:37): ShortWave, that's why I would rather have something, that already have been out there and use it, instead of trying to re-invent it..",
