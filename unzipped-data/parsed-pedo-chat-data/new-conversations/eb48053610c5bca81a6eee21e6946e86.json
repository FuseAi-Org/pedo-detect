        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:15): the good thing about 24 hour aeroplane trips (twice) is that you can catch up with all the good movies, finish your book, see some tv series, get sleep, read some newspaper material and get free food and wine all the time",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:22): to continue my monologue, I saw Babel, Blood Diamond, The Pursuit of Happyness, Freedom Writers, The Good Shepherd, The Holiday (not very good), Code Name: The Cleaner (not very good) and some other film of which I can't remember the title",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:23): about a teacher having an affair with a student and some other teacher abusing that situation",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:24): that's a whole lotta movies",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:24): 24 hours going there and 24 hours going back :)",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:25): also some episodes of The Simpsons and The Office (American edition)",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:26): you're back in time to watch the WG play Musical Chairs",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:26): maybe once we get up to 10, people will feel the minimum level of disagreement is met",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:40): how does throwing more editors at the problem solve anything?",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:41): isn't the editor solely the person who does all the hard work trying to please the WG?",
        "139513027e8e90b5582cbc68fc733884 (08:42): apparently they can do that better if they are fighting each other",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:42): 5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3: it depends on the group and the tracking issue system. I think one fundamental components of accountability of editing work is the issue tracking.",

        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:43): there's a mailing list",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:44): all debated WHATWG issues have a paper trail",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:44): all the non-debated ones probably don't have consensus",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:44): do the non-debated ones go into the document?",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:46): everything is in the document",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:47): which makes it easier to see how things might interconnect, what ideas currently are, etc.",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:47): for the editor :)",

        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:48): but how do you know as a reviewer if something has been already discussed.",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:48): parts of the spec are marked as stable or unstable",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:49): people made a little script that annotates the spec like that, although it's not entirely done yet",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:49): though currently it's pretty clear through things like red blobs",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:49): interesting",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:49): using class names?",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:50): are there links back from the document to the mailing-list where the issue has been debated?",

        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:50): or collecting the different thread",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:50): you can use google for that",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:50): or some other search engine of your choice, of course...",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:52): poor usability but it could work with efforts",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:52): this approach might not accessible enough for everyone, but people will have to step forward to improve the situation in that case",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:53): you can't leave it all up to the people who think it already works good enough, I think",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:56): my main worry is that the web communities surrounding html feel that they own the specification. And lack of tracking (power of hyperlink) dilutes trust often.",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:58): they just started feeling that or so?",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:58): afaik HTML development was sort of on hold",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (08:58): as far as the W3C was concerned anyway",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:59): it was not on hold. a part of the community decided to take one path, another community decided to take another path.",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (09:00): It is normal, it is part of market forces and pressures, on many sides with different type of interests.",
        "5fc737bb295227f3fddfc56d069349b3 (09:00): i'm not sure what you're trying to say",
