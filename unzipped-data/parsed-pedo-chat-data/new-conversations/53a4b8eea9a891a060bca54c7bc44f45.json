        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:20): they were mostly based on whatever i found when reverse engineering stuff",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:20): it's likely the wf2 stuff is based on what i thought would be good, vs html5's stuff which is based on legacy implementations",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (22:21): makes sense since WF2 is a submission format",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (22:22): I guess they are now as good as they are going to get",
