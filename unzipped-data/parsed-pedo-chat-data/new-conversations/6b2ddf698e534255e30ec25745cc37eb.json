        "28a6d36d2fd2e2e987a704be0c3f7b0e (15:31): first one nsIDocumentEncoder autodetects whether it's supposed to become an HTML or plaintext serializer",

        "28a6d36d2fd2e2e987a704be0c3f7b0e (15:56): smaug: so the pluggability of CDMs might be a way to sell the concept to Mozilla and Opera without anyone truly intending to follow-up with an actual pluggable CDM for any OS",

        "28a6d36d2fd2e2e987a704be0c3f7b0e (16:09): smaug: yeah, it would need to get out of the way of events that logically belong to the browser",
        "03cd618659ad3063c1d53077657a801c (16:09): it is just that it has been said in many emails how CDM would be a lot simpler than NPAPI",
