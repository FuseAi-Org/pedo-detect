When I first ran the disk, it told me it couldn't find my harddrive and I needed to run diagnostic or get drivers. Well, I tried the former and it didn't work. So I got drivers, and their on a floppy. I hit F6 and all, then it tells me to put it into drive A:. I do, and it scans for a moment, then asks me to put it in again. What should I do?",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:25): Tape, you need a special driver description file that can be understood by the Windows installer, not a standard Windows driver .inf file.",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:25): I suspect it will be called &quot;boot driver&quot; or something like that on the manufacturer's website.",
        "56b2c001dd879739cf85551d9a5851be (14:26): Yeah it's a dell. I got it from their site and it had me run an executable.",

        "56b2c001dd879739cf85551d9a5851be (14:34): Which had me put it on a floppy. I'm not sure whats on it because I can't see whats on the disk ATM (The computerI'm on now doesn't have a floppy drive)",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:35): Well I'll download it and look because from the description I can't tell what the package contains anyway",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:38): OK, I looked, it seems to contain what you need. You read section 5.3 of the readme and this: <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/imst/sb/CS-020825.htm\">http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/imst/sb/CS-020825.htm</a> right?",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:39): (you don't need to do all the unattended things, just the first section is really relevant to you here in the link)",
        "56b2c001dd879739cf85551d9a5851be (14:39): Yeah I did.",

        "56b2c001dd879739cf85551d9a5851be (14:41): Maybe. It almost acts like there's no disk in A: at all. It simply tells me to insert it and press enter when ready again.",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:42): Is the disk broken then perhaps?",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:42): Or the drive?",
        "56b2c001dd879739cf85551d9a5851be (14:43): I wouldn't rule out my drive. Few years of dissuse. I have another one I can try, though, so I'll do that. But the disk should be fine, as it worked about an hour before I put it in (when I put the stuff on it.)",
        "56b2c001dd879739cf85551d9a5851be (14:43): Thanks!",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:45): Well, sorry I couldn't really give you an answer, but hopefully it'll work okay the second time around",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:57): You could set the permissions on those running processes, I suppose",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:57): I don't know how the programs themselves would take it of course, they may go crazy if they receive a close request and then find that they aren't allowed to close after all",
        "d316c9f7a8e4eb8bdfcb60387200cdf8 (14:58): Hmm, yeah",
        "d316c9f7a8e4eb8bdfcb60387200cdf8 (14:58): There must be such a program.",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:58): A program that goes crazy, you mean?",
        "d316c9f7a8e4eb8bdfcb60387200cdf8 (14:58): Somehow system administrators must be able to prevent closing down firewalls or running services.",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:59): Don't allow users to stop services running in the localsystem, localservice or networkservice accounts is the usual way...",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:59): But you can set permissions on any process in theory",
        "d316c9f7a8e4eb8bdfcb60387200cdf8 (14:59): But then it'd need to be a service, instead of process.",
        "d316c9f7a8e4eb8bdfcb60387200cdf8 (14:59): Right?",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (15:00): Service is just a process running in a service account.",
        "006239103e64ac399d1426badcb17926 (15:00): well they shouldn't be running as administrators first",
