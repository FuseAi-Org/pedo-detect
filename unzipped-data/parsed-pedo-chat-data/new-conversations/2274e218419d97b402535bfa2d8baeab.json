        "e58157506c9454b759b72d895070ae86 (07:13): The way I usually go about it is I pick a style (flamenco, jazz, blues, etc), pick a tempo/rhythm, record a beat, lay down a riff over it and just build everything else based on that riff.",
        "4ee86ed63a222da106702c5082796675 (07:14): clean and structured, you must be pretty good huh?",
