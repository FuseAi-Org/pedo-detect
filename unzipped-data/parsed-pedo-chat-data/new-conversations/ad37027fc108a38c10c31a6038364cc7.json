        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (11:59): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: Only by calling about ten functions",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (12:01): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: Yeah",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (12:02): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: Like html5lib.parse is one for parsing",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:02): yeah",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (12:02): The only fun thing is you need to know what format the tree is in",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (12:02): (Like, is it dom, is it etree, etc.)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:02): yeah",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (12:02): That can be worked around by just doing stuff like hasattr",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:03): ah, yeah",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (12:03): (And hoping people don't do really whacky OO stuff subclassing stuff)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:03): hmm",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:03): people do whacky stuff",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:03): in general",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (12:03): Probably better allow it to be explicitly stated the format, but try sniffing if it isn't",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:05): my experience in product-dev orgs is that engineers always swear &quot;no sane user will ever do that&quot;.. and as soon as the product is actually deployed, we have actual users (customers) doing just what engineering claimed they'd have to be insane to do",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (12:06): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: anyway, sounds like something that would be great to have, and that nobody would argue against",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:14): we should also have html5lib.sanitize",
