        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:41): OK",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:42): annevk still awake?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:42): I asked him to update earlier today, so hopefully he'll do it whenever he gets up",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:42): I am assuming no",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:42): I asked him to update ~5 hours ago",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:43): even though it is an arbitrary milestone, I am for some reason very excited about publishing",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:47): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: I think the biggest positive effect of WD publication is that it gets documents a lot wider attention than just editor's-draft publication does",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:48): at least as far as W3C publication goes",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:48): and for a certain period of time, at least",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:48): in the context of HTML5, I have not seen it result in a higher level of technical review",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:48): yeah",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:48): though it does get some sort of attention in the tech press",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:50): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: yeah, the downside of that is that one of the first questions all the media people seem to ask every time W3C publishes and HTML5 WD is that, &quot;OK, so when will HTML5 be done?&quot; question",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:51): to which it seems to me the only proper response is to try to get them to see that they're asking the wrong question",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:51): but that's not usually successfull",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:51): then we can just point to the charter and indicate that the next milestone is Last Call",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:51): which is on schedule, so long as we can invent time travel technology in the next few months",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:51): heh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:53): the ietf guys argued that websocket would get wider review if we went through the ietf, but so far all the useful feedback i've received has been either off-list or on the whatwg list",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:54): similar to how it was argued that html5 would get more review if we went through the w3c",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:54): looks to me like the standards organisations are out of date in terms of what gets wider useful feedback :-)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:55): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I sent useful feedback on the ietf list... I think",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:56): i think everything you said on the list you first said on the adam/you/me thread we had",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:56): and adam and you would have reviewed the spec anyway, regardless of whether we went w3c, whatwg, or ietf",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:56): nah, I pointed out the reverse cross-protocol problem on the list first, then discussed it with you on IRC, then on the email thread with Adam",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:56): I would like to say I would have given that feedback anyway but I only thought of it due to people questioning the handshake",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:57): fair enough",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:57): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: standards organizations are out of date in a lot of ways.. I guess until we actually work on coming up with viable alternative, we are stuck with what we got, and hopefully at least we can (or have) managed to get some improvements made",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:57): I mean, I might have still had the thought",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:58): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: my most successful standard i think has been pingback, which didn't involve a standards organisation at all",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:58): it's not clear to me how to make a good standards org",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:58): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: so it's not clear to me that we _need_ an alternative",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (03:58): I think the existence of the Web Sockets discussion at IETF has helped to changed the IETF culture for the better",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:58): all the existing ones either come down to pay-to-play voting or dictatorship by an elite oligarchy, if you push hard enough",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:59): really? how so?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:59): er, that was to mike",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:59): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: i think the oligarchy mechanism is the only one that truly works, but it only works so long as the oligarchy has the respect of the implementors",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:00): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: and i think it pretty much stops having the respect as soon as there's a process in place, because a process forcibly distances the oligarchy from the implementors",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:00): part of the problem the w3c and ietf both have is that they try to solve too many problems at once",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:00): having multiple focus areas is a huge red flag for a std org imho",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:00): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I think the implementors issue is something that the Web Sockets work has helped to raise awareness about in the IETF",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:01): oligarchy can work with the right oligarchs",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:01): and so long as it does not get overwhelmed with legitimacy disputes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:01): legitimacy disputes = lack of respect",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:02): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: the awareness being that it is risky to develop a spec without also working hard to get implementor buy-in during the spec-development process",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:02): IETF and W3C try to have consensus/voting as the front line decision-making tool, with escalation to a dictator/oligarchy",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:02): sometimes I wonder if the other way around would work better",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:02): of course, in the HTML WG we kinda have a sandwich",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:02): not really",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:03): we just have three tiers of &lt;span&gt;abort the",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:03): mispaste",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:03): we just have three tiers of oligarchy",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:03): I guess layers at least limit the damage that can be done by any one layer going off the rails",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:04): each tier being further removed from the issues, leading to more and more random resolutions as an issue is escalated ;-)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:05): I find I need to have a lot more familiarity with the issues than I think I should have to for my role",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (04:06): wonders what Apple's Webkit devs are doing",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:06): right now?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:06): most of them are either at home, or having dinner",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (04:09): webkit devs seem to be doing a lot of bug fixing these days, as opposed to feature implementation",
