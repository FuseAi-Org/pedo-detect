        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (15:50): Why is it bad?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (15:52): I think most current UAs announce that images are images, rather than treating them like &lt;span&gt;...alt text...&lt;/alt&gt;, so it won't have the problem that they'll be indistinguishable from plain text (which is the problem that the new feature is trying to solve)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (15:52): that's probably true, indeed",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (16:03): besides, I don't think the huge amount of DSC_[0-9]{4,}.jpg's on the web are going to get sensible alt's anytime soon",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (16:04): {DSC_0201.jpg} is no more meaningful than [IMAGE]",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:04): a lot of my flickr images have meaningless titles",

        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (16:05): trying to fix the alt situation is like trying to explain every joke you ever tell",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:06): That would be difficult - usually I don't even know whether I'm joking or not",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (16:06): yet, alt is trying to describe everything",

        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (16:10): The proper alt-text would be &quot;Oslo needs to do something about it's begging problem&quot;",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (17:17): collegues climbed it last summer, I read on some blog of one of the former Mozilla XForms guys that he climbed it too recently; that's enough for me",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:18): I see that Kilimanjaro is entirely on the Tanzanian side. Somehow I had thought the border with Kenya ran through it. (I need to update my geography knowledge.)",
