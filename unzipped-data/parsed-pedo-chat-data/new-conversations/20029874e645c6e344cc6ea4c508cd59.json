        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (16:56): no",
        "1ed5214d432efe330c170975547201ee (16:56): .obj is pretty popular",
        "2d0a550b217b7122d4eb6831511d51ea (16:57): yes, I found that there are some libraries for loading obj files",

        "7fb04f199144453e78ebc8759b82af3b (17:10): guys.. another question, Ive started my hips/legs armature by extruding from the spine",
        "7fb04f199144453e78ebc8759b82af3b (17:10): but somehow in pose mode, the spine is not connected to the hips",

        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:17): hrm im no armature master, but i dont think the legs should be connected to the spine, they should be parented to the spine",

        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:28): but if you want to, you have to use 2 separate objects",

        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:31): it gives very bad results, most of the time",

        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:33): just a simple wall",

        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:33): press ctrl + R (that's the loop cut function)",
        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:34): you will see a pink line on your wall if you move your mouse over it",

        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:34): so move your mouse over the side of your wall",
        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:34): you will now see a horizontal pink line",

        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:35): move it to where you want the top of your door to be",

        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:36): but it's a line...",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:36): I need some cubic form as a door",
        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:36): yeah, so you need to make more lines",
        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:36): next, you can make the sides with 2 vertical lines",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:36): or you want me to loop it 3 times ?",
        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:36): yeah, 2 vertical now",
        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:36): and then you can cut it out",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:37): ok thanx",
        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:37): next thing is to select all vertices surrounding the door (shift-right click to add to selection)",
        "d2458157aca157b9e806d7f5445d3efe (17:38): that would be 8 vertices (4 at the front of the door, 4 at the back",

        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:45): yes thanx , I just used to 3dmax...that's a hole another story",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:46): does blender developing faster then other 3d programs ?",
        "7fb04f199144453e78ebc8759b82af3b (17:47): i'm faster wiht blender",
        "7fb04f199144453e78ebc8759b82af3b (17:47): cause of the short cuts",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:47): I mean the program itself - is it dveloping faster ?",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:47): yes",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:47): much faster",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:48): just love open source.... ;)",
        "dbacf1e91861351d2616728069e9baad (17:48): it could be argued tho that it's largely playing catch-up at this point.",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:48): we typically have a three month release cycle, commercial apps often have much longer cycles, probably at least a year",

        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:49): like linux ubuntu - every 6 months a new release",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:50): its not that far off",
        "be7acb0fdbe8360b94767339ede735f1 (17:50): well, when was 2.37? 1,5 years ago i guess",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:51): are you saying its longer than 3 months or shorter?",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:51): but what do you mean by new release ? blender 2.42a and 2.41 is the &quot;same release&quot;...",
        "be7acb0fdbe8360b94767339ede735f1 (17:51): longer",
        "be7acb0fdbe8360b94767339ede735f1 (17:51): thats the points",
        "be7acb0fdbe8360b94767339ede735f1 (17:51): -s",
        "be7acb0fdbe8360b94767339ede735f1 (17:52): and 2.41 is mostly a bugfix for 2.40 and the things that broke there",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:52): so wen blender 3 comes out ? ;)",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:52): and since when did that not qualify as a release? we had release candidates for them?",
        "be7acb0fdbe8360b94767339ede735f1 (17:53): can't remember",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:53): if you're gonna get pedantic, then yeh its probably closer to 6-8 month release cycles between major changes",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:53): in any case its still better than commercial apps",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:53): plus being opensource you dont actually have to wait for releases",
        "be7acb0fdbe8360b94767339ede735f1 (17:53): see, thats + 100- 166%",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (17:54): yeh and i qualified that by saying, major releases",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (17:59): the one thing that bugs me the most in blender - is when I in edit mode and I create a new object , it counts as one object",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (18:00): that is a great feature imo",
        "a7b9464a64d7a967c87d3acfcb5ec2e8 (18:00): and completely in line with how blender works with data",
        "d7e008af89960fc99358402c414ffb8c (18:01): in this case - how can I separate them ?",
