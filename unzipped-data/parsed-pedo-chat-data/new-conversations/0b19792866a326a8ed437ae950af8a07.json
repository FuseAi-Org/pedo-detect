        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:01): &lt;input type=file accept&gt; seems problematic",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): there don't seem to be any use cases that limit the type without also limiting other things, like image size, framerate, audio codec, or whatever",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:03): so it seems pointless to keep it",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:04): the main use case was to enable on-the-fly video/audio/photo upload, but maybe we're better off providing direct access to the camera/mic",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (03:05): that seems like that should be part of the file-upload spec",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:05): yeah, i was about to say that it seems like something to punt to the binary data work",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (03:05): which arun will be editing, it seems",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (03:06): I do agree we need to allow (controlled) access to camera &amp; mic",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:06): yeah that's been requested a lot from cutting-edge app authors",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (03:07): well, Flash has had it for many years",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:07): yup",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (03:07): and I'm sure Silverlight has it (or will)",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (03:08): hmmm... wonder how that plays into uploading RAW files from a USB camera/memory card? or would that just be a normal file upload?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:08): dunno",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:09): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: accept is more useful as a hint than a limit",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:09): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: so the UA can show a specialized media browser for audio, video or image types for example",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:09): instead of generic file open dialog",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (03:09): those files are huge... but photo-editing webapps would do well to allow them",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:09): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: does anyone do that? or have any plans to?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:10): Apple does not comment on future product releases",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:11): but I think it would be a swell idea, given that both Mac OS X and the iPhone have specific media picker UIs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:11): hypothetically, should someone want this to remain in the spec, would they want it to just be image|video|audio|mime-type ? or just image|audio|video ? or just mime-type? or something more elaborate?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:11): comma separated list, any mime supertype? parameters?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:11): I don't know if any of the other base MIME types are particularly useful",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:11): text and application don't tell you much",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:12): I guess font is a root type though?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:13): html4 has accept=&quot;mime/type&quot; iirc",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (03:14): single instance of mime/* (or just the base part) is the use case I would be most interested in",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:16): HTML4 has a comma-separated list",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:16): so i propose making it a comma-separated list _or_ one of &quot;image&quot;, &quot;video&quot;, &quot;audio&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:17): and the selected file(s) must either have the given types or be of the given category",
