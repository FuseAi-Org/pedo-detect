        "9d34e8d80cc917979ce7a15be472196d (20:07): so you want to just keep things under control.... noise levels?",

        "5e421bb8cc8c7da5eccb807728bd8895 (20:07): noise is no problem. my computer is about 28 decibals already and I can't sleep with it off",

        "fcef936e0d3bd5407c6f26bb456938dc (20:20): with aircooling you can easily set it to 220",
        "5e421bb8cc8c7da5eccb807728bd8895 (20:20): and resetting my BIOS is a pain",

        "fcef936e0d3bd5407c6f26bb456938dc (20:22): you can also just set the mem latency's higher",
