        "fe70b49783daa65bcb249805fb3a2b24 (21:13): the original post there is an odd sentiment",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:14): particularly the premise that it would be better for Mozilla to extend web technologies unilaterally rather than collaborate inside a standards process",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:16): though I do think some of the more complex parts should possibly be dropped if they don't get implementation traction",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:16): but that's a totally separate question from things that are seeing multiple active implementations",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (21:19): I don't think it's constructive to make a list of &quot;things I personally think should be dropped&quot; and not provide any justification",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (21:21): FWIW I agree...",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (21:21): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea++",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (21:22): er, I agree with you guys",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:23): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: I inferred that from your comment on rsayre's blog",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:24): WHATWG has been a remarkably effective forum for cross-vendor collaboration on improving web technology",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:24): it's pretty clear to me that it is *way* better than either stopping progress or each vendor doing things unilaterally in their own way",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:24): even if it results in a &quot;bloated&quot; spec",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:25): and I know from experience that it's hard to deliver that level of quality even for a much smaller chunk of the spec",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:27): it's a full time job",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:27): as soon as people employing spec editors realise that, things will improve :-)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (21:27): I was about to say, we've been very lucky that 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e has been paid to work on it full time",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:27): yes",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:27): i have been very very lucky",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (21:29): who are the great spec editors who are unemployed?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:29): to my knowledge there aren't any",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:29): the problem is companies won't let people work on specs full time",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:30): they try to &quot;get more value&quot; out of them by e.g. making them do QA work",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:30): e.g. opera wouldn't let me do 100% spec work, only 50% spec work and 50% qa",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:30): that's one reason i quit",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (21:30): It's not clear to me there is even a huge pool of great spec editors who are employed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:30): yeah well that's a problem too",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:31): the problem there is that you pretty much have to fall into this job after having gotten your hands dirty in a variety of more practical things",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:31): and that you have to not care that it's not an especially lucrative career",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (21:36): surely it's about the same as most other browser-related jobs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:38): in my experience software engineering has a much higher ceiling in terms of pay increases than spec writing does",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (21:42): ok, here's the plan. We'll get an article in TIME about you, titled &quot;Is Ian Hickson the most powerful man on the Web?&quot; That should fix it",
        "8276c305beb1ebf1529fb8592cb24083 (21:43): Google should allow more people to be powerful on the web :)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:47): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: hah",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (21:49): runs in fear from the great 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (21:50): but seriously, if you need outside feedback on how awesome you are to impress your managers, I'm sure that could be obtained",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:51): eh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:51): thanks for the offer",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (21:51): er, &quot;heh&quot;, not &quot;eh&quot;",
