        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:54): Seems like there's a danger that for any accessibility-related problem, I could just say that ARIA can probably solve it, so that's okay, and then I don't actually know how to use ARIA and haven't got a clue how to test it even if I did use it, so I'll just leave it until later (i.e. never implement it)",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:54): yep",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:54): I can cope with understanding accessibility at the level of &quot;if all images are replaced by their alt text, the page should still be usable&quot;, but that's about it",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:56): easiest way to test these things is to ask some real users to test them (e.g. jaws-users mailing list, <email/> etc.)",
        "ef6f2287bae00ba79475fbf56c2b6fee (01:57): VO/FireVox/Orca/NVDA are also relatively easy to learn, though hard to use the same as someone who needs to use them in anger.",
