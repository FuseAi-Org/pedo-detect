        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:47): Remember the whole host body thing?",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:47): I didnt EAT him",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:47): And I can use his hands",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:48): But yeah the tentacle thing isnt gross till they dry out",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:48): Yuck",
        "076595e584d35a6d860cf0d633caee6d (07:48): oh..i figured he was kind of done for..",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:48): Still till they dry out they are kind o f good for self pleasuring",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:48): Well he is done for",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:49): But his body is fine",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:49): Its like..",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:49): Zombies. The person dies but the body and sometimes the memories remain",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:49): The difference is that zombies rot",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:49): And are mindless",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:49): Ish",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:50): Seriously though im sure you think the whole tentacle self pleasuring thing is gross. You being a human and all. Am I right?",
        "076595e584d35a6d860cf0d633caee6d (07:51): umm..a little odd, yeah..but i try not to judge..its called cultural relativism",

        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:52): Just more proof that being stuck on earth isnt so bad huh?",
        "076595e584d35a6d860cf0d633caee6d (07:53): no its not bad..and hey..if you turn out not looking weird you might not get stared at very much=)",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:54): Yeah but I dont plan to reveal myself at LEAST till you humans master space travel",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:54): cause by then having a plantlike creature suddenly appear wouldnt be too odd would it",
        "076595e584d35a6d860cf0d633caee6d (07:55): hey we&apos;ve been to the moon...more than once i think..",

        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:56): Once you hit space stuff like me would probably be unusual in the sense that theres ONLY one of me",
        "43d77a6cff496e0f03342d604d1deea0 (07:57): I mean just think of all the crazy stuff that could be lurking in your own star system!",
        "076595e584d35a6d860cf0d633caee6d (07:57): yeah..i just watched planet 51 so i know all about inter planetary relations...",
