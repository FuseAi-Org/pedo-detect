        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:37): now remembers that HTML4 mentions the &amp;{ script }; syntax as being reserved for script macros, and wonders if that could be used for text expansion of templates since it shouldn't conflict with existing syntax",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:39): which isn't overly pretty",
