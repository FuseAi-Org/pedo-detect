        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:16): and then stay over on the 23rd and 24th at least",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (05:16): maybe head back on the 25th or even 26th",

I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll miss the after-party but I wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be able to drink anyhow",

        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:19): before-party sounds great, esp. as it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s an afternoon event",

I guess somewhere reasonable (they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re paying) and near the venue, which hopefully means convenient for you both outside the covered day(2?)",

        "1e10d84b3917ae58049be95b0071cf7f (05:26): not sure if that means just saying that you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be there, or if they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re sounding you out as a speaker",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (05:55): e.g. for 'margin' you need a hashmap and for 'cursor' you'd need a list",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (05:57): another constrain is that both the hashmap interface and list interface might need to be implemented on the same object in certain scenarios (for backwards compatibility; if something changes from being just a hashmap into a comma-separated list of hashmaps)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (05:57): current sketch I have:",
