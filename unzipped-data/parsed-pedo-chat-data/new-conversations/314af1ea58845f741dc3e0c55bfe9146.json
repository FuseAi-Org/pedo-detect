        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:12): can I quickly fix that, as well as the date?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:12): or are you editing?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:28): I've made some edits that still need to be checked in",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:29): crap, it should be using the editor's draft template.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:29): can you do that?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:30): Yes, it will get fixed with the next check in",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:31): i meant checking in",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:33): Hmm, Android SDK includes Ogg Vorbis",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:35): Hmph, html5lib cheats with reprocessing and fostering",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:35): like if you say &lt;table&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;a&gt; then the implied &lt;/a&gt; doesn't go through the &quot;in table&quot; mode",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (16:35): needs to learn how to use W3C CVS from my Mac, instead of having to do it from my home PC all the time",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:36): You fail a test that does &lt;table&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;a&gt; and expects a certain number of parse errors :-)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (16:36): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, the date is still broken",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:38): can't find an instance in html5lib where it would cause a different parse tree",
