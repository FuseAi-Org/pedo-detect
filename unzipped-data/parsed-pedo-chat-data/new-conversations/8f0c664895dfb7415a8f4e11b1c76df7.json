        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:06): that power outage ruined by 250+ day uptime",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:06): (on the box linux box routing all my network traffic, which i installed about 250 days ago)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (11:07): I wonder if development of the 'uptime' program was secretly supported by the people who make UPS devices",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:08): hah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:09): are UPSes any good these days? 15 years ago they could barely do 7 minutes for your typical load",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:10): wow, apparently not",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:10): 3 minutes?!",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:10): 5 minutes?!",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:11): $378 for less than 7 minutes at barely 1kW?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:15): surely something that can be put under a desk, that doesn't need to handle continuous drain-charge cycles, and that is plugged into the mains most of the day, can do better",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:16): i wonder how much petrol would be needed for a generator to support a 1kW load for an hour",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:17): surely we have rechargeable materials with more efficient power densities than petrol by now",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:19): and now i find UPSes haven't improved in like 15 years",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:19): i know chips improve, and laptops improve, and software sure has improved, and network connectivity has improved",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:19): so wtf are the printer and UPS people doing?!",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (11:22): working on their uranium-powered printers in their secret lair ? ;)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:24): i expect hte next gen printers to be able to print onto a whole ream of paper at once without moving any of the sheets, so that you just stick a ream in, and then you pick it up three seconds later and the whole ream is fully printed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:24): DOUBLE-SIDED.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:25): and the next gen UPS had better just be a cable you can replace your current cable with",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (11:25): nono, they print the paper as well",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:25): which lasts 72 hours on one charge, charges in 5 seconds, and can support 10MW loads.",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (11:26): looks like you're going for an Uranium Power Supply there \u201a\u00c4\u00b6",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:39): wow, the comments from some of the CSSWG memebers regarding selectors api on public-webapps/www-style seem surprisingly confused about how it works.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:40): also about the use cases that are being addressed, but that's slightly more understandable if they haven't actively followed its development",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:42): I suppose I should clearly document all of those somewhere, outside of the mailing list discussion, for easy reference.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (11:42): I'll put it on the whatwg wiki",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:00): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, is a mac mini particularly entertaining for some reason when it's on?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:01): perhaps if you use it as a media centre",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:06): You could use laptops with one laptop acting as a wireless router, connected to the internet via the mobile phone network",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:06): Also, you could entertain yourself by reading a book",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:06): So there's really no reason to worry about power cuts at all",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:07): (Well, for the book you might need some candles too)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:10): (from Python interpreter)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:10): seems to be about the only documentation, given that the wiki seems to have lost its pages",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:13): isn't that a unit of brightness",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:16): candles are a fire hazard, especially because you need a few hundred of them to replicate the amount of light obtained from a decent 100W incandescent bulb (or equivalent).",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:22): It's possible to see quite adequately without needing the equivalent of a 100W incandescent bulb",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:23): isn't suggesting using them as an identical replacement for current electrical lighting systems",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:49): Well, you could use the light to illuminate the book and not the entire room",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:53): has a 20W desk lamp that's easily more than adequate",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:59): I know what everyone finds comfortable is different, but I can't work with desk lamps. They give an uncomfortable bright spot while the rest of the room is comparitively dark.",
