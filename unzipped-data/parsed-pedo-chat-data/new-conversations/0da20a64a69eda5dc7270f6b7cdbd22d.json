        "30acf32f65007f527c482fef01043f22 (22:03): yes",
        "30acf32f65007f527c482fef01043f22 (22:03): you can",
        "decc59fff71f0ea0665e0695a6122e36 (22:04): later i would use 2 ldap servers one colocated in a datacenter and one local. is it possible to set a failover? so when the internet link fails the local thing still works?",
        "30acf32f65007f527c482fef01043f22 (22:05): that I can't answer",

        "6317e750caaed5378e08991e16865f3e (22:29): rsync doesn't just sync a set of files, it uses a special protocol to sync parts of files, and only moves diffs.",
