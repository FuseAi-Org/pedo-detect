        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (08:42): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: &quot;This image is randomly selected from Flickr using Yahoo!&quot; ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:42): that wasn't the one i was thinking about, but that's another example, yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:43): http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1180683614&amp;count=1 is one example",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:43): the second two images are just decorative",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (08:58): &quot;just decorative&quot; as of 4.8.2.1.6. &quot;A purely decorative image that doesn't add any information but is still specific to the surrounding content&quot; ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:58): yeah",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:58): oh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:59): well those are kinda different",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (08:59): but they both get alt=&quot;&quot;",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:00): i just want to understand the semantics of the new &lt;img&gt; rules ...",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:00): so what was your rationale to not have these images in CSS ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:01): they're allowed in CSS",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:01): but it is often convenient to be able to put one-off images in the markup instead of CSS",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:01): otherwise you end up with many one-off rules in CSS",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:02): well, inline CSS is still allowed, or isn't it ?",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:02): then, more correctly, if these images in your blog aren't like &quot;4.8.2.1.6.&quot; ones, what semantice function do they have ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:04): hm, you're right, these kinds of images simply aren't mentioned",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:04): i should add a section about them",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:06): &lt 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e&gt; hm, you're right, these kinds of images simply aren't mentioned",

        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:06): ah thx",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:08): ok, noted the request",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:08): i'm still a bit confused - what exactly distinguishes them (the 2 imgs in question) from &quot;purely decorative&quot; ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:08): how do you mean?",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:09): well, the first image has a very specific alt text and is clearly related to the text. clearly something would be amiss, if there weren't.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:09): right",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:12): so what would be amiss, if the second type of image just went away ? if the answer is &quot;something&quot;, it should (semantically) be viewed as content (and thus probably have an alt text ?). if the answer is &quot;nothing&quot;, then images of this type are deco, or aren't they ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:21): nothing would be amiss",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:21): the only reason to put these in html rather than css is conveniene",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:21): convenience",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:45): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: i believe this should be discouraged. i mean, i remember people who laid out tables &quot;for convenience&quot; ...",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:47): using tables for layout causes harm, because it makes the page less accessible, in that the page doesn't represent the actual structure of the page, and pretends to use a data table when it does not",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:47): these problems don't occur with using &lt;img&gt; for one-off purely decorative images",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:48): that's right, indeed.",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:50): but the semantic value tends to be zero and that makes me somehow uneasy.",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:50): (my table analogy was only from a pure semantic POV, not from a practical accessability one)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:51): i agree that using css for this should be encouraged",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:52): but there's no reason to make this more complicated for authors than necessary just for purity",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:55): well, it makes the rules more complicated, but it certainly is a viable solution for those who don't need the flexibility provided by CSS.",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:57): is there something intended for the spec like &quot;best CSS practices&quot; perhaps in an appendix ?",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (09:58): like &quot;Things that you CAN do with this specification but they are better handled using other technologies that are further described herein&quot;",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (10:01): or should this rather be the domain of tutorials ?",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (10:01): (as in, not mentioned anywhere in the spec)",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (10:04): putting best CSS practices in an HTML spec seems like it's a bad idea",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (10:04): I'd suggest CSS best practices go in a CSS spec of some kind",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:06): 7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6: for the img case i expect when i add the aforementioned section i'll mention that css is potentially a better plan too",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:06): but in general no, there's no plan for tutorial-like stuff there",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (10:06): good \\o/",
        "7f9405da4034bf43083e64b57302a8e6 (10:09): i was only asking b/c of &quot;10. Things that you can't do with this specification because they are better handled using other technologies ...&quot;"
