        "431d94cfba63fa3a13fb014f3038ee9c (04:43): Anyone here recomend rentacoder.com for html projects? I need my web site completed.",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (04:53): can I apply pseudo classes to classes?  e.g. is .class:after { ... } legitimate?",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:15): Can someone tell me why the following would happen and if there is a fix:  I have &lt;div wrapper&gt; &lt;div sidebar-left&gt; &lt;div content&gt;",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:16): pfn: Yes, that's legal",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:16): when I do a float:left for #sidebar-left and a float:right for #content i lose my border properties for #wrapper?",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:16): suedoh_: You don't lose the border, but the two divs go out of normal flow, meaning the wrapper has no reason to be bigger than 0. It collapses.",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:17): suedoh_: You need something after those divs inside the wrapper to have clear:both",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (05:17): are there any negative consequences to setting class=&quot;&quot; on any element?",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (05:17): I imagine no...",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (05:17): nanobot thanks... that's what I thought, I wonder why it didn't show up for me correctly...",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:17): Nanobot: Give me a sec, I'm trying to understand :)",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:18): pfn: You realize that IE doesn't support :after, right?",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:18): Nanobot: so what would be the most common way to do it ?",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:18): should i put a &lt;div inside of wrapper after sidebar that has a clear:both ?",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (05:18): nanobot yes",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:18): suedoh_: After content",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:19): ok thanks",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (05:19): I do most of my work in FF",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:19): and the exact property is  clear: both;",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:19): ?",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:19): suedoh_: Er, wait, is content inside sidebar-left?",
        "042f3b97816f38fc28999a500a3fef78 (05:19): I would appreciate IE7 if it increased css support... assholes (msft)",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:20): suedoh_: And yes, clear:both;",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:21): It would be after whatever is floated, but inside the container that you want to show up",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:21): And the clear element has to have some sort of content or height value so it doesn't collapse",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:23): Nanobot: Awesome, that hit it.",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:23): I'm not sure I understood much about it, but I'll have to read up.",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:23): Thanks",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:24): table-less Webpages are hard for me, as i've not done them much",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:25): When something is floated, it goes out of normal flow, kind of like when something has position:absolute. So whatever is after the floated element isn't below it like it normally is.",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:26): So the container has nothing forcing it to be bigger than nothing, and it collapses.",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (05:26): If you put something inside with clear:both, it pushes that element below anything that's floated, therefore forcing the container to be larger",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:28): awesome, cleared it up",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:28): thanks",
        "ff14f7e683f1f4fc1f97ae84c35aa1c4 (05:28): and this works for Firefox and IE also?",

        "1c7f00e4057d97c61c62ee266d1fa423 (05:55): i think its a route you should take",

        "1c7f00e4057d97c61c62ee266d1fa423 (05:55): which they are, in some rare cases",

        "1c7f00e4057d97c61c62ee266d1fa423 (05:58): so i guess you could classify that as a flaw",
