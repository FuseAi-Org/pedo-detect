        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:22): not tai chi .. but something softer .. for exercise",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:22): Well, I don't really concider tkd to be violant",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:22): mrEriksson: it was i can assure you ;-)",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:23): Oh,,, Still, I don't see it.",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:23): at least when i happened to kick someone with a roundhouse kick and the police came .. gah it was horrible :-/",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:23): On the other hand, I've only been doing it for three years or so..",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:24): mrEriksson: what is your rank?",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:24): colour of your belt?",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:24): but i cant judge it, ur itf",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:24): Well, perhaps,, But imo tkd does not focus enough on how to get power in your kicks..",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:25): 4 cup only",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:25): thats pretty good anyway",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:25): Well, perhaps,, I just enjoy the exercise :)",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:26): belts are a side-effect :)",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:26): yeah.. at least wtf focus to much on game-teckniqs .. not so much on self defeence",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:26): Umhum,, I think that's the problem with both itf and wtf, both have lost the focus on what it's all really about..",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:27): mrEriksson: you are prolly true!",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:27): On the other hand, wtf is WAY more focused on competition, and they have ALOT more members too :)",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:28): So I guess that could be a reason for this to.. Members are needed to pay the bills :)",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:28): yeah, therefor i somewhat is drawn to jujutsu, they are more focused on selfdefence, and if you want to compete, the you combat-jutsu",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:29): but the best self defence is of course to run away and stay out of trouble :-)",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:29): anyway, I don't do tkd because I love the style or believe it to be the best thing there is,, but it's an exercise-model that suits me quite well and the club and its members are great..",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:30): mrEriksson: okay! Its great training thats for sure!",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (03:30): Right, I do like jujutsu more too,, But that's probably because it was the martial art I first started out with :)",
        "2aa7ab3f80e084633d4023ba44bdae87 (03:31): aha :-)",

        "6977059742023c2cd6e40e71a2ed9b8e (03:54): but there don't seem to be any patch to do the proper kernel integration (on files.?, attach/detach code ...)",
