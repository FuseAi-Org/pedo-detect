        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:23): I think the amount of time it will take will depend mostly on how soon others step forward to take Sam up on his offer to work on it together",
        "f47636673b14c54021a69dc06f6a19fb (08:26): hmmm how much sometimes I prefer rdf to html for lists you can sort and rearrange on the spot",

        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (08:41): anybody who believes it is good needs to go the reeducation gulag to be de-brainwashed",

Franco (Spain), Nazi occupation in France, etc.  It helps to achieve of lot of social laws in France. etc etc etc. There are always more than one side.",
