        "84d2e1a6bc7e42378c104f2689760792 (08:18): i just think that FF missed there goal by a long shot. they started out by being lean and mean and left mozilla get all the extra crap and then they just turned into mozilla",
        "84d2e1a6bc7e42378c104f2689760792 (08:18): so much built in that doesn't blong in the default version",

        "e8f7159de0ffa489a4f49ef24c83a197 (08:28): the first bloat they ever added imo is the rss reader, i bet like 5% of users actualy use it",
        "e8f7159de0ffa489a4f49ef24c83a197 (08:28): prob more like 0.5%",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:29): the whole 'applciations' handling section based on content type is pretty retarded too imo",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:30): just hook into the OS defaults for anything that can't be rendered properly by the browser",
        "e8f7159de0ffa489a4f49ef24c83a197 (08:30): i think thats designed for basic linux systems that done have any sort of DB",

        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:33): despite the fact indexed db isn't even close to ready",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:34): and basically every OS out there has sqlite running on it for one reason or another already anyway",

        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:35): indexedDB is like 5 years away at this rate",
        "e8f7159de0ffa489a4f49ef24c83a197 (08:35): people still say that about #html5 tho",
        "e8f7159de0ffa489a4f49ef24c83a197 (08:35): its not ratified yet but a lot of people use it",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:35): and localStorage is useful only as a cookie alternative with some benefits obviously but still a far cry from a client side database",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:35): once you get more than about 2,000 entries in localStorage it starts to bog down the browser bigtime",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:36): websqldb by contrast can hold 100,000 entries and chomp through it with little effort",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:37): sqlite is perfect for client side databases, that is why it's used by so many applications already - even OS X uses it for &quot;Core Data&quot;",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:37): why reinvent the wheel",
        "e8f7159de0ffa489a4f49ef24c83a197 (08:37): hmm, some reason i thought SQL was a propritary standard that everyone emulated. simaler to the start of *nix but i guess not",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:38): indexeddb may be the best thing since sliced bread but it's so far from ready i don't see any reason why ff wouldn't support it in the interim",
        "e8f7159de0ffa489a4f49ef24c83a197 (08:38): avoid a changeover headache for when its ready maybe?",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:38): well originally SQL was proprietary but there are SQL &quot;like&quot; implementations out there like sqlite, postgresql, mysql that are all opensource and *widely* used",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:39): i think the real reason is, they couldn't get it to work with their horribly mucked up code",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:39): and the reason they've released ff4/5/6/7 in rapid succession is they are trying to clean things up in preparation for actually extending it",
        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:40): they may have improved the javascript core and rendering engine to an extent but i wonder how much of that they stole from webkit lol",

        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:41): they just copy and paste the method and alter the prefix from -webkit to -moz lol",

        "335248f18d8d9f97618415474cba59ba (08:43): i think that all started mostly because of IE",
