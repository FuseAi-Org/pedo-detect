        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:01): nvidia *corporate* host... thats balls",
        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:02): WET54G has the sensitivity of a KGB officer.",
        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:03): Anyone give me a heads up on equipment that doesn't suck ass?  -_-",

        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:05): but its about as sensitive as a US soldier in iraq...  it might kill you and everyone in your extended family.",
        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:06): Likely.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:08): I prefer atheros radios performance-wise, but they're damned hard to find a truely stable atheros rig without spending entirely too much money",
        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:09): Well I am coming from 'back in the day' when a wet11 was shit but still adequate for long haul point to point.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:09): bleh",
        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:09): I need something that will run into a 24db dish and not fail completely.",
        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:09): It was crap but it worked... enough.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:09): well, it depends on what you're dealing with",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:10): if theres say, a canopy system 2 miles in front of your 15 mile link",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:10): it doesn't matter whatever radio you use, its not gonna work",

        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:10): Rural 802.11b",

        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:11): Why?  If the sensitivity was not bad enough for the linksys product, the noise issues would be enough to can it.",

        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:12): 802.11b dislikes multipath",

        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:14): 11b has more &quot;sensitivity&quot; but it considers a lot more of the signal &quot;noise&quot; than 802.11g does in not-quite-perfect-LOS situations",
        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:14): Ok, I will keep that in mind when I am playing the part of 'wisp'.  Right now I am client.  I have no control over that. ;_;",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:15): Senao 2611CB3+ would be the best choice for 802.11b",
        "13860a12a95325377fd566a38b1be13b (03:17): Ugh. 4:30pm Friday, call comes in. Customer says, &quot;We haven't been able to load pages very well for the last 3 days.&quot;",

        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:21): I drive by their house (its a RB112 with an AP set up on the 2nd card) and no AP talking",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (03:21): so I call... nobody's home",

        "13860a12a95325377fd566a38b1be13b (03:27): Damn black helicopters. Hard enough to make a living w/o your customers being abducted.",
        "cf61725b58097f05f7887fd6faad390f (03:28): With abductions you can at least make up the lost revenue via the selling of anal probes.",
        "13860a12a95325377fd566a38b1be13b (03:30): No market here, too many molestors offering them free.",
