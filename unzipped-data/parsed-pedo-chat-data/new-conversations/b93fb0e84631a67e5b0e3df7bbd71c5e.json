        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:08): the former, since that's what I implemented",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:09): kk.",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:09): it's efficient, I do it in O(N) time in the number of stops, and it's reasonably simple",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (01:11): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: does @rel no longer allow URI tokens?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:12): it's never allowed tokens that aren't registered as far as i recall",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:12): registering them is pretty trivial though",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:17): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: Changes made, and are visible in the draft on my site.  Thanks for the &quot;specified position&quot; terminology - I was struggling with how to say that.  Also rearranged/reworded linear-gradient()'s treatment of the two &lt;angle&gt; cases to allow the behavior you've implemented.",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:17): yay, thanks",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:20): No problem; thanks for implementing it.  ^_^  I'm speccing the repeating-* functions now.",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:22): BTW, Firefox builds with the implementation here: https://build.mozilla.org/tryserver-builds/<email/>-try-89caaae7381c",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:23): There any instructions on installing ff builds?  Never done one before.",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:31): depends on the platform",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:31): but these builds install just like any other Firefox release",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:32): if you're on Windows, the easiest thing to do is to just download the ZIP, unzip it somewhere, and run firefox.exe",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:32): it's that simple",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:33): and make sure you're not already running a Firefox process",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:33): you may want to run &quot;firefox.exe -P&quot; and create a new profile for testing, that lets you run concurrently with an already-running Firefox",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:34): Don't you need to add -noremote or something?",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:34): yeah, you probably do",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:35): So it's not quite that simple ;-)",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:35): running with a different profile can also be good because there is also a small chance that running a trunk build with your existing profile will cause problems when you go back to using your release version with that profile, although that has never happened to me, so the chances are very small indeed",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:36): Since I do IRC using chatzilla, being able to run it concurrently seems useful.",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (01:36): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: perhaps Tab runs IE as his main browser? :-)",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:37): No, I run chatzilla in FF, gmail in chrome, then everything else in whichever one is handy when I ctrl+t.",

        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (01:41): chatzilla as its own app is so much money it's not even funny",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (01:42): especially back when its link-opening behavior wouldn't open a new tab but rather blow away the most recent one",
        "40cddb5ac261f4694179715cd8424278 (01:43): sigh... I'm trying to learn some simple &lt;canvas&gt; stuff (using Dive into html5 as a guide), and I can't even get past the first bloody getContext. Javascript hates me :(",

        "40cddb5ac261f4694179715cd8424278 (01:56): The &lt;canvas&gt; has to be before the &lt;script&gt;? I had the script in the head...",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (01:57): Is there some way I can do something equivalent to &lt;div style=&quot;background: black; opacity: 0.8&quot;&gt; (on top of a background image) that also works in IE6+?",
        "40cddb5ac261f4694179715cd8424278 (01:57): Whee, it works after moving down the script. Thanks, ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c!",

        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:57): Philip: use a PNG and one of the pngFix libraries?",
