        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:13): I use it all the time for people's names when I quote from blog entries.  I usually use it for both the author and the article title.",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:16): maybe I've been using it wrongly all these years. I don't know",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:16): So it's superstition? :-)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:17): i did that too, but it recently learned that the convention is that those names should not be in italic and other than that there was no apparent benefit",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:18): ok. If there's no typographical convention for people's names, then I guess I'm wrong",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:36): it's a serious offer",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:36): yeah, I even had some serious offers once",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:38): but it's finite time, has limited impact on my software, has zero maintenance cost, and gives me a share that i think is acceptable",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:38): on annevankesteren.nl?",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:40): hmm. seems like they are partly paying for the google juice",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:46): or maybe not, check this out: http://www.google.com/search?q=site:w3.org+viagra",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:46): have Google stated that links on pages like that pass no link pop?",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:46): just ebcause they are told not to follow them, doens't mean they can't take them into account for link pop",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:47): 80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5: IIRC, nofollow is a misnomer and means nopagerank",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:48): well, when I first mentioned nofollow, I was on about rel=nofollow, and yes, google suggested using that to combat spam, and have since recommended it for marking up ads as well",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:48): because they don't feel those links should pass PR",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:49): but the robots meta tag is a bit different",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:49): oh",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:49): the W3C seems to think they aren't selling google juice, though",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:50): heh, well it's come up in SEO circles a few timesa about the 'paid links' the W3C has on that page",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:50): but it's pretty obvious that those who buy placement on that page think they are buying it",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:50): especially as it's a high authority domain",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:51): now and then i read something or hear something from these so-called SEO's and i often doubt they know what they're talking about",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:51): toolbar suggest that particular page has a PR of 8, a link from like that is worth a fair bit :)",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:52): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: there are lots of people who call themselves SEO guru's who think meta keywords still make a difference in ranking",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (13:52): on the other hand, there are numerous people who do have a clue :)",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (14:03): ok, having checked, it seems Matt Cutts has stated that meta nofollow does the same as rel=nofollow, so those links should indeed NOT be passing google juice",
        "80a2d9aa2e7b8108d042b8b4b94c69c5 (14:04): the page is indexed, so the links can be found as part of the page, but they aren't benefiting the recipients in terms of link popularity :)"
