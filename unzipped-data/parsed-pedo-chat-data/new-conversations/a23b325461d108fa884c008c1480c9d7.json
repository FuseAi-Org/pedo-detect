        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:22): we're obviously not going to ship Acid3 fixes in Safari 3.1, since it has already shipped",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (21:31): WHAT!?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (21:31): You're kidding, right?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:33): what is the smallest SVG spec?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:33): that's right, we can't go back in time",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:33): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: probably the VML note that MS proposed is the smallest SVG spec :)",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:34): 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6, seriously, what's the smallest?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:34): I honestly don't know, but I'd have to guess SVG 1.0",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:35): that said, I think SVG Tiny 1.2 is much more clean and well-defined",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:35): I should clarify--I meant number of features, rather than spec length",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:35): and though it has features some people don't like, is a better implementation target",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:35): a long spec detailing a small number features would be best",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (21:35): guesses 1.1 Tiny/Mobile",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:35): oh, then probably SVG Tiny 1.2",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:36): oops",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:36): SVG Tiny 1.1",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:36): but that doesn't have scripting support, so most browsers already pass that by",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (21:36): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: why?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:37): each version of SVG has somewhat incompatibly changed the semantics (mostly minor)",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:37): I want to use SVG for a purpose that doesn't have many requirements",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:37): for instance 1.1 technically requires you to catastrophically fail at rendering any time any attribute value is invalid",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:37): just simple drawings",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:37): then SVG Tiny 1.1",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:38): hmm, it has animation",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:38): true",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:38): guess I have to make SVG 1.1 ReallyTiny",

        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:38): interactivity is not required either",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:39): I don't think there is an SVG spec that is only suitable for simple drawings and no more",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:39): then you can simply do a profile of SVG",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (21:39): some are more out of control than others",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:39): there's an appendix that describes various profiles, including static",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:39): lemme find it",

        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:41): I don't need links",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:42): that's also used for inbound links, like image references",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:42): well, I only want to allow data URLs for those",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:42): do I have to use xlink to get that?",

        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:43): well, &quot;src&quot; would be three characters",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:44): it is not hard to implement, I agree",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:44): just verbose",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:44): &quot;r&quot; would be one character",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:44): the size of a data:URL is going to dwarf any attribute name",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:45): but now I have to use namespaces",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:45): or more than one, anyway",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:45): always a sign of trouble",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:45): is going to avoid this religious issue",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:46): well, it's not religious in this case",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:46): I don't need this to be extensible, so namespaces aren't helping much :)",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:46): netsplit!!! run for your lives!",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:47): 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6, so are the features discussed in this appendix the same things I would find in SVG Tiny?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:47): or is there a table that explains this concisely somewhere?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:48): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: not sure... look in SVG Tiny 1.1 for the featurestrings there",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:48): I don't know of such a table, but I think it would behoove the SVG WG to make one",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:49): I'm happy to bring that up, or champion it if you sent an email to www-svg explaining your use case",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:49): well, I'm still exploring right now, so I think my explanation would be bad",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:49): but I will do that eventually",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:50): ok, that'd be great",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:50): interestingly enough, I was just writing an email about how static SVG is taking off more and more",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:52): it looks like the Mobile/Tiny stuff insists on interactivity",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:53): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: I think an SVG Core spec for static SVG, without interactivity or animation, would be interesting",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:54): or SVG Static, whatever",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:54): do you think it would take a long time to specify? or would it be a cut and paste job?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:54): it might be of interest to drawing tools and other scenarios where they think SVG is too heavy",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:55): 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4: more or less the latter",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:56): but finding time and resources to do that within the WG might be hard, considering that most of the participants are interested in dynamic, scripted, animated, and interactive aspects of SVG",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:57): seems like it would be uncontroversial as a W3C Note",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:57): if this is of interest to Mozilla, and you put some resources in (and maybe helped find other participants who would do the same), I think we could do it",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:57): I don't think it would be controversial as a spec, actually",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:57): just a matter of resources",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:57): tbh, I'm kind of dismayed it doesn't already exist, and wasn't considering resource allocation",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:58): so I'll see how this goes",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:58): ok, let me know",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:58): like I said, that featurestring is a reasonable profile",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:59): is curious what 14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 is planning... is this for Mozilla?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:59): yes, it is, but it's just my pet project",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:59): guesses it's for Thunderbird",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (21:59): that's cool",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (21:59): nah, I don't work on Thunderbird much",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:00): wonders what one would call a project about pets, to distinguish it from the term 'pet project'",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (22:01): but this is unrelated to Firefox's general SVG stuff",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (22:01): taxidermy?",
        "14af4ca97e316b17ea96286dc6882fd4 (22:01): sorry I'm being so dodgy, I'm not ready to talk much about it",
