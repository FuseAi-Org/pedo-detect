        "99b3de46135082c6f99f26ced7d4c248 (02:43): Collibri, yes, if you explicitly specify that you use BOCHS (ie means a reproductable environment)",

        "ce4cb0f56a7080f7e37881760c79fffb (02:49): btw. are there any thoughts about using of gettext (or similiar) instead of hardcoded text",

        "ce4cb0f56a7080f7e37881760c79fffb (02:52): its easier for translators - translate just one text file for all os-related things",

        "ce4cb0f56a7080f7e37881760c79fffb (02:53): okay, but gettext is more flexible and preserve a fall-back-language",
        "99b3de46135082c6f99f26ced7d4c248 (02:54): .rc files too. ENGLISH/US is the fall back language",
        "ce4cb0f56a7080f7e37881760c79fffb (02:55): in short: no gettext",
        "99b3de46135082c6f99f26ced7d4c248 (02:55): exact",
        "99b3de46135082c6f99f26ced7d4c248 (02:55): .rc files work well (and call contain other things than strings, like icons, images...), so no need to use another thing",

        "9d285d46b2c0e0aa048cf3596b841569 (03:00): i dunno much about rc, but i think if it works for microsoft it'll work for ros too",

        "99b3de46135082c6f99f26ced7d4c248 (03:01): i dunno much about gettext, but what if you change the original translation (probably the english one)? you need to update all others as well?",

        "d0c44a952ebaa6c33871cf8b7e05fedb (03:02): at least, if you change the source code instead of writing a new translation from source to english...",
        "d0c44a952ebaa6c33871cf8b7e05fedb (03:02): dunno if you can do that or not ;-)",
        "d0c44a952ebaa6c33871cf8b7e05fedb (03:02): I suppose you probably can",
        "99b3de46135082c6f99f26ced7d4c248 (03:03): SamB, so, you end up with broken english in source and correct english in another place...",
        "ce4cb0f56a7080f7e37881760c79fffb (03:03): okay, but all english texts are extracted from source automatically",
