        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:53): role is magical",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:53): Somehow everyone will know and agree on which roles mean what, and never use them incorrectly or make up their own roles",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (14:59): The people talking most about it are the accessability people, so screen readers",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:00): hmm.",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:00): &lt;i role=&quot;shipname&quot;&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt; for example?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (15:01): Sure",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:01): how is role supposed to connect to RDF, anyway?",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:01): I mean how does it differ from class?",

        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:03): hmm, from what I see on the mailing list, people want to say role=&quot;foo:shipname&quot;",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:03): where foo is a currently bound namespace prefix",

        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:04): how exactly will user agents &quot;learn&quot; about new roles",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:04): is it really intended that UAs will read the RDF and then magically know what to do with the role?",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:04): exactly!",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:04): that was the kind of insane magic thinking that came out when XML Namespaces where designed",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:05): &quot;a namespace is a URL, user agent dereferences URL, downloads schema for namespace (why?), magically knows what to do&quot;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:05): was it?",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:06): RDDL was a language designed for that very purpose",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:06): to add namespace metadata to an XHTML page that sits on the namespace URL",

        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:06): so that hypothetical user agents could go and download it and learn new tricks",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:07): I don't know how many smart people burnt processor cycles on that idea",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:07): the fact that most user agents don't even bother downloading DTDs should have been a hint",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:07): (Prince does, actually :)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:07): does it learn new tricks from DTDs? :)",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:07): sadly, no :)",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:08): but wouldn't it be awesome if you could just define new elements in the DTD,",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:08): and they got all kinds of custom rendering behaviour automatically,",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:08): and we didn't have to do any work! That'd rock.",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:08): ...and a pony.",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:10): I mean, the only thing you can do in RDF that doesn't involve writing code,",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:10): is tell the user agent that a foreign element is equivalent to some other known element",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:10): like, if you see a &lt;foo&gt;, treat it just like you currently treat &lt;blockquote&gt;",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:11): now that might be handy, from time to time, but it's hardly a world changing feature.",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:11): i meant with my first remark that it appears that that was what spawned the role idea in the first place. then they thought &quot;hey, this can be useful for other stuff too!&quot; or something",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:11): and made it even more complicated",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:11): so it was originally proposed for styling form controls?",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:11): seems like improved CSS selectors would solve that one",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:12): dunno, just speculating. i don't understand the problem it's trying to solve really",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:12): indeed",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:12): or selectors are already powerful enough",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:12): role was from XHTML 2 originally though, right?",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:12): probably. does it make a difference?",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:13): just trying to find out where it all began",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:13): looks like it was an XHTML module:",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:13): http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xhtml-role-20060725/",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:13): that came afterwards",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:13): as an attempt to &quot;ease migration to xhtml2&quot; (or so the draft says)",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:13): It is used by applications and assistive technologies to determine the purpose of UI widgets.",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:13): ah, okay",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:13): (UI widgets sentence should be in quotes)",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:14): yeah",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:14): thing is there already is HTML markup for UI widgets!",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:14): &lt;button&gt;, &lt;a href&gt;, &lt;input type=checkbox&gt;",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:14): the example has it on a list: &lt;ul role=&quot;navigation wai:sitemap&quot;&gt;",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:14): &lt;nav&gt;",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:15): &lt;nav&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sitemap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;...",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:15): to be honest, some of these role values remind me of rel=&quot;&quot;",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:16): I can sort of see what they're trying to do with it, and it's not *too* insane",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:16): but the idea of qnames in attributes, and linking it to RDF via namespace URLs is just stupid",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:16): role seems to be like an accessibility patch for poor CSS support in browsers and badly written markup",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:16): the whole point is to have a small selection of values that user agents understand",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:16): which might be a good thing",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:16): some of it could also be handy for mobile rendering,",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:17): like when you want to chop the page up into bits to fit on a small screen",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:17): you want to know where to chop, and role could help with that",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:17): i mean, if there is old content with &lt;img onclick&gt;, it's easier to add role=checkbox than to change it to &lt;input type=checkbox&gt; and restyle it",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:17): but again, define a small number of roles, make sure user agents understand them, ditch the namespace stuff",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:17): yeah",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:17): people might go nuts inventing new role values, but that's fine",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:18): since it's not useful for styling, only accessibility nuts will go nuts, which is okay",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:19): hmm, just like the rel attribute, actually",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:19): rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot;",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:19): and the hook for OpenID",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:20): rel=&quot;openid.server&quot;, works fine with no namespace support",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:20): it's just that every W3C specification has to pay homage to RDF at some point...",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:21): indeed, i don't see why namespaces are better than naming conventions",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:22): naming conventions seem to be more successful in terms of usage and implementation",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:23): some implementations of RSS rely on the convention of how the namespace prefixes are written!",

        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:25): yes",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:25): pseudo-XML formats, not really XML",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (15:25): but namespaces should never have been defined using URLs to begin with",
