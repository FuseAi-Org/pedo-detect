        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:17): well i don't mind gc'ing removed iframes, but if you have an xhr from that iframe, it seems like a good reason to keep it around",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:17): i mean, how often does that happen?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:17): it's not like it'll be a massive optimisation to keep it around",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:19): i just got a server send me back an error message telling me IT had timed out waiting for my browser to send the request",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:21): I had this awesome test from a removed iframe where I changed the location and then tested if the base URI was correct and people whined :/",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:21): which people?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:21): leaving the page cancels pending loads, so logically removing an iframe should cancel pending loads in that frame",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:22): I don't remember",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:22): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, well, the thing is that XHR still had an implicit reference to that iframe",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:22): after all, isn't removing an iframe from the document pretty similar to closing a window or navigating to another page?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:22): (the effect was that open() throwed an exception",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:23): oh, so this is about having a not-currently-loading XHR from a removed iframe?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:23): you create an XHR instance using the &lt;iframe&gt;'s Window object",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:23): you do this from some other document",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:23): I guess I am ok with open() throwing in that case",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:24): unless it is a compat issue",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:24): then you delete the iframe, and set &lt;iframe&gt;.location",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:24): in which case I'll want to stab whoever coded their site that way",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:24): then once it has navigated you call xhr.open(); xhr.send() to see what the effect is",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:24): i wanna stab a lot of people",

        "b9acb5df457f56156060d93d0827b8ac (12:26): You say &quot;random&quot;, thay say &quot;forward compatible&quot;",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:26): People won't stop putting random garbage in their pages unless we provide significant negative consequences to those actions",
        "b9acb5df457f56156060d93d0827b8ac (12:27): (which is fair enough because that's what they've been told to think, even if it is garbage)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:27): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: and even then, apparently",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:28): yeah, you can just drop the dependent clause",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:28): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: That just means the current consequences are not significant enough",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:28): or that the rewards aren't enough",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:29): no one has an incentive to be more punishing, so that's not a relevant counterfactual",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:30): then hsivonen would be spending his time railing against the biscuit-seeking behavior",

        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (12:35): I guess it's more enforceable if you pass a law requiring strict parsing and police the browsers",
