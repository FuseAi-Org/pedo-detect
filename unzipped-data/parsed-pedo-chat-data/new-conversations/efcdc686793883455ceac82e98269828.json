        "a02622c45eb22ef57d99330e2b404407 (18:57): there is a 'third-party' Breakthrough Systems which advertises scsi target mode drivers for solaris",

        "a02622c45eb22ef57d99330e2b404407 (19:11): and realizing the backspace key mapping was wrong I remembered about the Sun keyboard on the old IPC",

        "1ab6e9f9996c38f2e4eac24956b2b6cf (19:15): i don't know that a sun x86 keyboard will help tho, i have one hooked up to my pc at work and when i ssh into a sun box i still have to fix the backspace key",
        "da0e57e706a98c1977faf3a3cf26b5eb (19:15): cane someone explain to me, hy you cant have a cname like ( myname cname myname.domain.com) where you have an A record myname.domain.com 192.168.1.10",
