        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:31): No, in fact to my knowledge it doesn't even support ALL of the SVG standard.",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (23:31): hm, the font that QGraphicsSimpleTextItem uses isn't &quot;normal&quot;, it's an outline font",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:31): chakie: I mentioned that. ;)",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (23:31): no, it supports the &quot;tiny&quot; thingie",

        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:32): Did something unusual happen when you scaled it up that high?",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (23:32): well, not &quot;huge&quot;, 24pt",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:32): Ah.",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (23:33): 48pt looks kinda nice",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (23:33): but it's not practical :)",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (23:34): nah, scaling it looks really bad",
        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (23:35): it's still an outline that gets scaled, and when it's scaled to my &quot;normal&quot; small size it's a mess",
        "e177a053e6927b9e8d443b8e2fee10e0 (23:35): ahigerd, &quot;support ALL of SVG&quot;? If you mean SVG 1.1 Full, which viewer does? Even HTML+CSS is usually not perfectly supported yet. SVG developments go fast nowadays",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:36): Hehe",

        "e8d02d72bee77f86138ae3caa93f5e4b (23:38): i think i should report a bug about this, it worked right in rc1",
        "099bbfab0c29724b260374e1d4238ca3 (23:52): I'm building someone else's qt4 project. There are .pro files. What do I put in the .pro files to make it build a static binary?",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:54): CONFIG += static, but you also have to have a statically-built Qt library.",

        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:57): I keep two copies of Qt around -- one dynamic, one static -- and I call the qmake binary for the appropriate version when I need it.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (23:57): (The Windows installer comes with both sets of libraries already built.)",

        "099bbfab0c29724b260374e1d4238ca3 (00:12): Google for it. A hex digit (i.e. four bits) is sometimes referred to as a nibble (or nybble).",
        "099bbfab0c29724b260374e1d4238ca3 (00:12): Ah, yes.",

        "92a5653ef0a74265fb40402cdc70d697 (00:15): I see... I'll try to do it with MinGW...",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (00:15): Of course, if you're not a commercial customer, using it with Visual Studio is a hack anyway ;)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (00:15): And I don't even think it builds on Cygwin at all",
