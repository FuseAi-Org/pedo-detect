        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (09:51): well, some security researchers believe that the web security model ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-abarth-principles-of-origin ) is wrong and that by entrenching it further with CORS we are making things worse",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (09:51): specifically, that people will design solutions with CORS that will open them up to become &quot;confused deputies&quot;",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:54): why is the html spec the place to define how aria works in svg?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:55): or if that's not the proposal, why would we want multiple definitions of how to implement aria?",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:23): i still think it'd be better to be explicit in the definition",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:24): i think you're better off introducing an explicit child list, something like &quot;an object in a tree has a parent and a child list&quot; and then define everything in terms of that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:25): and have that instead of &quot;has a number of properties that other objects do not&quot; which is a bit weak",
