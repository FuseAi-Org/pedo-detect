        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (03:32): (i.e., 12 \u00ac\u00b1 1 cm)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:32): That's not really 12 +/- 1",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:32): because 12.4 + 1.4 = 13.8 which is a long way from 12 + 1",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (03:36): Hah. It gets better.",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:36): I love when positive values get errors that go into the negatives",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (03:39): Even my best results have big enough error bars to make them useless.",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:43): had a few physics practicals in his first year, and half of them involved calculating g to increasing levels of precision",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:43): The first was something like rolling a ball down a slope, and getting something like g = 9 +/- 1",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (03:43): I've managed to do that as far as 9.8 \u00ac\u00b1 0.1",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (03:43): The best guy in my year got to 9.81 \u00ac\u00b1 0.3, IIRC",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:44): If I remember correctly, the third experiment involved some pendulum thing which was surprisingly accurate",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:44): What if you got 9.80 \u00ac\u00b1 0.2, would you prefer that to 9.81 \u00ac\u00b1 0.3?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (03:45): (This was doing something boring like dropping a double mask through a light-gate)",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (03:45): I wonder how many would prefer the 9.81 one because it looks more correct :)",
