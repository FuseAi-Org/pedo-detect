        "74993c117b67ba5d6eb5ca65f3dd8d99 (03:58): one thing about th real world is nothing is every absolute, so by real definition she wouldn&apos;t have been the wrong person or perfectly right, no such thing exists as we are only human",
        "74993c117b67ba5d6eb5ca65f3dd8d99 (03:58): she may have been more wrong for me than someone else, and THAT i can agree to :)",
