        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:38): trololol",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:42): I thought you wrote a test suite for XHR",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:43): yeah 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 pointed that out",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:48): oh, test suites",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:49): I need to look at my notes about invalid EventSource tests",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:50): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: but in any case, thanks for writing tests!",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:50): 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, they've been around for a year now...",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:51): xhr and eventsource?",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:51): do you happen to have tests for xhr.timeout already?",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:51): (someone is implementing that)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:52): I have not written tests for any of the new features and I don't think I should",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (18:52): It's bad to write both the spec and the tests",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:53): true",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (19:00): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e, so what should I recommend instead of replaceWholeText?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:05): 8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81, parentNode.normalize() and then setting data?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:06): or maybe just say to use textContent",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (19:08): Takk",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:09): graag gedaan",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (19:22): &quot;verbose&quot;",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:23): also seems like what Google is doing is the whole point behind having such attribute values",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:23): that you can offer different UI",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (19:27): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: ooh, second time an &quot;assistant-resolved&quot; bug got escalated :-)",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:32): deadline coming up",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:32): sort of forgot about that",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (19:34): Only 175 for HTML5",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:35): 30 bugs to WONTFIX per day :p",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (19:55): noticed http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13684 (on event handlers and DOM Events) while looking through those bugs; been meaning to write about that so that was nice",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:04): Oh, it's already text/vtt I see",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (20:07): i sort of like the idea of dropping &quot;web&quot; from webvtt, simply because there's nothing about it that's web-specific, and having &quot;web&quot; in there could (minorly) hinder adoption",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (20:08): only casually, though, it's already had one name change",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (20:10): (on the other hand, &quot;vtt&quot; is slightly less googlable than &quot;webvtt&quot;)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:15): 06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6, we could still call it WebVTT (although I don't think it's a good idea to prefix specifications with random words such as &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Web&quot;), just not have &quot;Web&quot; become an intrinsic part of the format",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (20:16): if it's baked into the name of the spec, that's what people will call it, so the file header probably doesn't matter much at that point",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (20:17): well, i guess what people end up calling it is out of our hands--if people name the files *.vtt they may call it &quot;vtt&quot; no matter what we do",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (20:17): edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e: I wanted the signature to be &quot;WEBVTT FILE&quot;, it's already been reduced to &quot;WEBVTT&quot;. I don't think we should go down even further.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:20): I guess in the end it's just another string, like XMLHttpRequest",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:21): (Not that WEBVTT is that bad ;))",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (20:21): WEBVtt?",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (20:22): WEBVtt to represent a file format name WebVTT? that's a mind-bender :)",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (20:22): named",
