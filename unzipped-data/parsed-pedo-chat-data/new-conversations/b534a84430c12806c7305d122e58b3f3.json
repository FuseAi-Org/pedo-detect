        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:07): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: i'm glad i didn't specify the expansion algorithm, you came up with something quite interesting that i hadn't thought of",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:07): i was thinking of using an extensions to CSS",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:07): also, you don't need a registration mark in your example",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:08): the only other thing is you'd want to have the input elements update the items",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:10): e.g. onchange=&quot;dataNode.setAttribute('value', value)&quot; value=&quot;&amp;{this.getAttribute('value')}&quot;",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:21): they could show more browsers that way too",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:21): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: that would certainly make it easier to see the trends",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:22): I'm not sure why I bothered putting the registrationmark in, since it's useless without scripting",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:23): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c: these stats also don't include the iPhone browser, which i believe would be interesting to see",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:25): (you can also see Nintendo Wii in the OS share stats)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:33): Joel's letter # VI confuses me",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:34): afaik Google has at least two systems that compile languages down to JavaScript (with the source languages being Java and JavaScript respectively)",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:35): there's also less reason on the web for a single library-level SDK to dominate, since there is no bundling/integration issue",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (23:48): there's no way the iPhone could have more market share than S60 globally",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (23:53): I guess WinCE shows up pretty high too though",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:56): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: the XBL is only required if you want to start making custom new widgets, which isn't anywhere near as important in this case afaict",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (23:57): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: ARIA is about retrofitting custom JS+div widgets with accessibility if I've understood correctly",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (00:00): What'd be really nice is a scripted implementation to test things with :-)",
