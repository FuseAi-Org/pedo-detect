        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (05:18): laptop mobo is about as tough an environment as you can get",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (05:19): it is very delicate",
        "9282591d40cb3ac247815e11f1944a93 (05:19): ok",
        "9282591d40cb3ac247815e11f1944a93 (05:19): so should i try to fix a solder joint myself, or count my losses and sell the laptop?",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (05:19): do you know what joint is broken?",
        "9282591d40cb3ac247815e11f1944a93 (05:19): nope",
        "9282591d40cb3ac247815e11f1944a93 (05:19): i havent opened it yet, everyone keeps telling me its most likely a solder joint tho",
        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (05:19): i wouldn't assume that you can do anything about it unless you can ID the matter first",

        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (05:20): it won't hurt to look, of course",

        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (05:20): just use an egg crate to keep track of all the different kinds of screws",
        "9282591d40cb3ac247815e11f1944a93 (05:21): good idea",

        "ae2723c5c3c9da84b0c32669c7b01e60 (05:27): i find it kind of unlikely they differ much",

        "7af9ed44c95eb990000a3012e875db85 (05:43): Yeah",

        "7af9ed44c95eb990000a3012e875db85 (05:52): Full duplex will most probably reduce latencies, and let you transfer more bandwidth easier.",
        "2bcb9498bc548cba6952ce92a409acf1 (05:53): ok",
        "2bcb9498bc548cba6952ce92a409acf1 (05:54): there is a cisco catalyst 2926 that I just found which seems to be pretty damn good but it's one of the moddles with out full-duplex",
        "2bcb9498bc548cba6952ce92a409acf1 (05:54): I think I have decided to just go with whichever one is the most espencive on ebay though :)",
        "2bcb9498bc548cba6952ce92a409acf1 (05:54): unless I can find one that has full duplex..",
