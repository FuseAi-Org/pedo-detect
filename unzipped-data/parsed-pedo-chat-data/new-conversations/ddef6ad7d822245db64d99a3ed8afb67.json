        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:23): scabootssca, ever try a linux chat to set up dual booting?",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:23): not a 3d modeling chat",
        "4512b2fd591581d44579f368c583b2d1 (08:24): there is no #linux channel",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:24): it would only make more sense",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:24): neighborlee, is there a #linux channel still?",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (08:25): ##linux",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:26): ah, xchat automaticlly spinds me over to ##linux whenever i would go in there",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:26): but i havent been there in so many months now",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (08:27): Hmmm, I'm guessing this wouldn't be the place to ask a question about Elephant's dream?",
        "4512b2fd591581d44579f368c583b2d1 (08:27): i think it would",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:27): scabootssca, just use ubuntu, it will take you through it all",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:27): eugman, it would indeed",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:28): eugman, you didnt like it either, i take it?",
        "4512b2fd591581d44579f368c583b2d1 (08:28): i need windows for other stuf otherwise i would",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (08:28): It's not that entirely.",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:28): scabootssca, same here, i just need windows for video editing and effects, but bleh, linux has nothing good enough for me",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:28): ShortWave is made of money, so he can have multiple setups, but im stuck with a low income and this laptop ive had for a while now",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (08:30): It's that it seems like the only person who can tell me some of the background facts is me and that's a bit annoying. I suppose I'm just young but it feels like it's lacking finality because I'm left to interpet and assume verything.",
        "4512b2fd591581d44579f368c583b2d1 (08:30): ok i'll try i hope i dont break anything....",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:30): eugman, no, i feel its a bad movie as well",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:30): no story, no plot, no character development",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:31): as i told it to ShortWave, it's nothing more than an animated gallery of what blender can do",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (08:31): Truthfully, I thought it was an intro and they had the credits at the beginning. Then I realized that was it and they weren't going to explain anything.",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:31): i feel there's no finality also. probably because we waited so long, and there's absolutely no story at all",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (08:32): Of course the lisencing means someone could in theory redo it and make it a bit better but apparently it took 125 days on the renderfarm.",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:33): i wouldnt blame any of the animators, just put all the blame on the producers and the &quot;writer&quot;",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (08:34): I'm not blaming the animators I'm just saying it doesn't reem feasible to render a longer version at any great resolution.",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:42): it was a good try though",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:43): for the time given for the project, it was a good job done",

        "6bdf4521165fe0d0fae23a0112289d95 (08:51): thought of a neat idea for my f1 detailing  :)",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:52): Strongbad2, what a way to show maturity in the blender community",
        "1d71c026fe4d19177dac56a77f7209dc (08:52): i wasnt being mean",
        "1d71c026fe4d19177dac56a77f7209dc (08:52): i just said hey go to elephantsdream.org",
        "1d71c026fe4d19177dac56a77f7209dc (08:52): and pointed to the link at cgtalk",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (08:52): they dont come in here touting &quot;haha, maya was used for monsters inc., finding nemo, haha! you guys have puney crappy elephants dream&quot;",

        "6bdf4521165fe0d0fae23a0112289d95 (08:54): :)",
        "e49b501505957738629836b48125c0be (08:55): I've been trying to figure out, how do i render with the radiosity that i just calculated?",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (08:57): Well, you've got to reverse the polarity of the lumines equalizer and then re-adjust the perocity of the voluminator.",
        "6bdf4521165fe0d0fae23a0112289d95 (08:57): if it calculated radisity then it should have rendered with it",
        "e49b501505957738629836b48125c0be (09:00): eugman, lol",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (09:03): I guess it's a bit obvious I don't model, eh?",
        "e49b501505957738629836b48125c0be (09:04): [Relic], is it supposed to render while it is calculating?",
        "13c252ae27b88f703dc1806b696bb3c4 (09:04): considering the fact that most people didn't enjoy elephants dream, I wouldn't be doing too much flag waving about it.  I appreciate the effort that went into it, and the advances that blender received as a result, but I think alot of people are very dissapointed with it.",
        "6bdf4521165fe0d0fae23a0112289d95 (09:05): if it actually says it is calculationg the elements in the dos-box it should be",
        "13c252ae27b88f703dc1806b696bb3c4 (09:05): Everyone, and I mean everyone I have asked about it, said they found it very hard to watch the whole thing",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (09:06): If that had been the intro and then there was another 50 minutes afterwards that made sense it'd be awesome.",
        "6bdf4521165fe0d0fae23a0112289d95 (09:06): you have the radi button checked in (F10)",
        "1d71c026fe4d19177dac56a77f7209dc (09:06): well i think for Orange 2 it should be the prolouge to this movie",
        "18e573f3f7440bacaa50826055a2cf57 (09:08): Seriously I'd just be satisfied if there was a background paragraph that said what was supposed to be going on. But it seems like that isn't the point.",
        "e49b501505957738629836b48125c0be (09:09): Relic, the radi button is on, and nothing seems to be working. It looks great in the 3D view...",
        "13c252ae27b88f703dc1806b696bb3c4 (09:10): I would like to see something a little more like a pixar short.  It doesn't have to be childish, but why does almost every indy project have to be so dark with hidden meaning",
        "1d71c026fe4d19177dac56a77f7209dc (09:10): I am trying right now to convert a movie with VLC, and i can only get sound",
        "1d71c026fe4d19177dac56a77f7209dc (09:10): does anyone know how to do this properly",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (09:13): Strongbad2, use another piece of software",
        "6bdf4521165fe0d0fae23a0112289d95 (09:13): not sure exactly what you are doing so it is hard to tell, and the 3d view isn't too accurate  :)",

        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (09:15): in the time it took to ask that, you could have googled it, and found the website and realised it was indeed free",
        "e49b501505957738629836b48125c0be (09:15): Does anyone know a good radiosity tut, that tells you how to render it?",
