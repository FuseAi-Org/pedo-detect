        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:06): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: in the Infoset coercing mode? it should trigger name munging",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:07): since it's not an XML 1.0 4th ed. plus Namespaces 2nd ed. NCName",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:07): &lt;foo:bar&gt; would be a well-formed NCName",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:07): foo: just wouldn't be bound",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:07): which is a separate problem",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:08): oh i see what you mean",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:08): but then what about the attributes that _do_ have colons?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:09): the name that is interesting is the local name after the possible XLink adjustments",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:10): so xlink:href on an HTML element would get munged but on a foreign element it wouldn't",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:19): (because the UTF-8 conversion wasn't portable to GWT)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:20): i'm speccing the name munging to just be &quot;replace the bad character with 'U' followed by the five character codepoint&quot;, as in '.foo' -&gt; 'U0002Efoo'",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (11:20): I suppose UTF-16 to UTF-32 conversion is doable, but not too useful",
