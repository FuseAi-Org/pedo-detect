        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:16): I'm looking for a windows app somewhat similar to the telnet emulator, only instead of telnet I need it to emulate a linux console (command prompt)",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:17): does anybody know of something like that?",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:17): Kyuss, CygWin offers a complete Linux environment and shell..",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:17): &quot;telnet emulator&quot; ?",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:18): do you mean the thing that happens when I type 'telnet' into a cmd prompt?",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:19): quux, Some peoples knowledge of the English language isn't as good as yours. They have trouble explaining themselves. Their question has been answered; move on and don't start a worthless argument.",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:19): no, there is a full blown telnet emulator floating around",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:19): mheath: precisely why I am asking.",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:19): more precisely, I believe it is a simulator",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:19): because I am not sure what's meant; and to answer questions when one doesn't know what's meant is just all kindsa bad",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:20): Kyuss: hmm, never heard a telnet emulator in windows",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:20): Kyuss, telnet is a very simple program to view the raw text coming back and forth on a network connection",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:21): Kyuss, there isn't such a thing as a 'telnet emulator'. A telnet client isn't something you would...emulate.",
        "de5057fbbac6623965fe11701309c7fb (11:21): quux, telnet?",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:21): I'm aware of that, I was using that as an analogy of what I am looking for",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:21): if what you want is bash in windows, there are two alternatives I know of. cygwin, mentioned above, and 'services for unix' a free download from MS",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:22): hmm, coLinux might also qualify",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:22): cygwin is too much",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:23): if cygwin is too much, then you won't care for coLinux or SFU",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:23): Kyuss, There are other options to run BASH, the program that provides the &quot;Linux console', but they're not particularly useful without a GNU environment to go along with them.",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:23): and I'm not looking for the environments to run in parralel, more like the bash window as a child process.",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:24): how to explain...  like ZSNES running a rom on a windows machine",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:24): that's basically be cygwin",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:24): Kyuss, BASH is a program for accessing files in a GNU environment. BASH in itself is worthless. I think you're looking for something like cygwin.",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:25): he's right. without all the little widgets like 'ps' and 'wc', bash doesn't do much",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:27): indeed, but I just need the bash and several of the system commands (ls, cat, man, etc) and gcc.",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:28): Kyuss, gcc requires a complete system to be emulated. Cygwin is your best bet.",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:28): I think I found something good... L-nix",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:29): umm. thats so you can go through a tutorial that explains commands like cd and cat, and then it pretends like you're really running cd so you can try it out.",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:30): Thats not going to let you run gcc.",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:30): AHA! <a href=\"http://www.eduflex.com/unix/simulator.htm\">http://www.eduflex.com/unix/simulator.htm</a>",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:32): .....again. That obviously PRETENDS to be a UNIX shell in a very primative way. It is not a system capable of running GCC.",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:32): do you think it is written using... dot net?",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:33): Kyuss, GCC is a complex program, that depends heavily on a working ld-linux.so (a working gnu libc), and on binutils.",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:33): It is not something that you're going to find a working version of in a 2MB downloaded pretend simulator.",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:35): what is hes problem",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:35): mine?",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:36): Kyuss, it's wierd that you are gravitating to 'emulator'",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:36): why is that?",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:36): sandix, Wants a GNU/Linux system simulator and for some reason won't face the fact that Cygwin is the only thing that does what he needs.",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:36): oh no not one of those",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:37): i was just bout 2 tell him 2 look at cygwin",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:37): Ahem. Help or not help; marginalizing folks who ask questions is not good form",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:38): quux, and talking down to me like your the god of all things is also not good form, but I usually don't complain about that :)",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:38): Form, function, semantics and arguements",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:39): Kyuss why do ya need that anyway ,",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:40): brb for a sec coffee is ready ,",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:40): I needed it to pass off to a teacher so he could lecture using a linux environment without fear of him breaking the machine itself",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:40): aha!",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:41): oh",

        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:41): in that case ,",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:41): it seems that is what it actually is what ya can use this for ,",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:41): so your gcc compile command could actually just be a script that prints dummy output that *looks* like compilation ..",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:41): but i am not sure cause ive not tried it ,",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:41): cygwin is a full blown windows/gnu integration",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:42): if I give him that...  he will make the computer explode",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:42): lets start somewhere else if ya are here when i come back ,",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:44): Kyuss, does this teacher run with admin privs?",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:45): Kyuss, Cygwin is not a Windows/GNU integration. Cygwin provides a GNU Lib C lookalike in cygwin.dll and allows programs to link against it (by way of /lib/ld-linux.so) in the cygwin linux-like-environment simulator.",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:46): Kyuss, but, given your scenario, have you considered downloading a simple GNU/Linux LiveCD and allowing the demonstration machine to boot off of it?",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:46): ooh, there's a good idea",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:47): the teacher doesn't have access to make it boot from a cd",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:47): or give him a vmware player instance",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:47): and I don't have access to give him that acesss",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:47): so the teacher runs with limited privs?",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:47): Kyuss, ....vmware is just a program. If you can't run it, you're not going to be able to run a simulator of any decent quality anyway.",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:48): if yes, I wouldn't worry; he can't damage anything other than his own userprofile",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:49): I'm actually quite satisfied that exactly what I am looking for doesn't exist",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:49): which means...  4 months of coding :P",

        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:50): want to see if I can do it",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:51): if I can, great, I put together a webpage and sell it for $30/year liscense and start cold calling university teachers",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (11:51): Well, I think you are reinventing a wheel, but if its fun, go for it",
        "193bd2f4aaeeb18c3ba3e1ba716d9231 (11:51): ehm",
        "fb769254bd8842f273d3bb4b29774af7 (11:51): and whats wrong with reinventing the wheel?",
        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:52): Kyuss, university teachers can just run GNU/Linux, or boot from a LiveCD.",

        "62f2afe20b2b3611f12446c74a37d601 (11:53): Now, where was I. Oh yes...leaving.",
