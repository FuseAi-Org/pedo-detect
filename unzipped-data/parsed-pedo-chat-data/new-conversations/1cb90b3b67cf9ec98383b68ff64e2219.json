        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:22): (specifically a mac laptop, though even a desktop still requires two keys)",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:24): peh. it depends on the keyboard!",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (22:25): my mac laptop requires two keys (fn+up)",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (22:25): but I had to tweak terminal.app keymappings",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:26): yeah i'm tweaking settings too",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:26): I think it's just fn+up here too",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:26): But there again I've little idea what the defaults are",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:28): ok i can do it with one hand now",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:28): shift-up and shift-down",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:32): i don't suppose there's a way to control what double-click selection behaviour is, either?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:32): s/either/too/",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:32): on putty i have it set to just select uri characters, which makes it easy to select uris",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (22:32): doesn't know of any",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:33): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: AFAIK no",
        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (22:33): pre-leopard Cmd+DblCLick was &quot;load link&quot;, not it's Cmd+Shift+DblClick",

        "150ca666565bfcb850b2e2ee3c0f0c64 (22:33): kind of a pain",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (22:33): indeed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:34): yeah but that selects | characters",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:34): so it doesn't work well for me either",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (22:49): interleave problem found",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (22:59): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I tried to interleave rdf:RDF with *",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (23:18): othermaciej: &quot;although I'm not sure if the Microsoft request it was responsive to has been made public&quot; ... those earlier discussions never were made public (as far as I can tell), that's the problem",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (23:19): This is a powerful reason why the private w3c-css-wg list needs to die.",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (23:24): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: it didn't since duplicate names in interleave are prohibited and * is a duplicate of everything",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (23:24): (this is a really annoying feature of RELAX NG)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:25): i don't think we want to allow RDF _anywhere_, btw",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:25): &lt;select&gt; &lt;rdf...&gt; would probably not work well",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (23:25): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: I thought you said earlies that RDF was OK where metadata elements are OK, i.e. in &lt;head&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:25): i'd recommend just allowing rdf at metadata and block/inline (soon to become &quot;prose&quot;) entry points",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:26): i may have misunderstood what you meant",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (23:26): I didn't mean * quantifier. I meant the * name class",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (23:27): currently, I don't allow RDF on the prose level at all",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:27): that works for me too",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:29): (Now I've imported the XSLT schema and so the XSD-&gt;RNG converter just gives up and dies before getting that far)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (23:30): (Incidentally, I'm probably doing stuff stupidly since I really have no idea about any of this, but at least it seems to be working at the moment)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (23:40): yeah, we need to figure something out",
