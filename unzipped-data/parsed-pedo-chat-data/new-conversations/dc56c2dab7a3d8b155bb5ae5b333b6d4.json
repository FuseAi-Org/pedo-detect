        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:34): which is the best impedance for wifi cables? I mean, wifi cables for antennas. And, by the way, are BNC connectors allowed or they may create problems?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:34): 50 ohms",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:34): bnc is only rated to 2 ghz",

        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:34): J4k3: my god, that's why the signal is absent :D",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:34): &quot;ethernet coax&quot; will only work for a few feet..  &quot;few&quot; being 3 or less.",
        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:35): J4k3: mine is 1mt long",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:35): 1 mt is about 3.3 ft iirc.",

        "5970bd1634756232824f68fe3b6bb725 (14:35): yeah ok whatever that is, has that much loss?!",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:35): at 2.4?  hell yeah",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:36): its ok at 900",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:36): well &quot;reasonable&quot;",
        "5970bd1634756232824f68fe3b6bb725 (14:36): interesting.",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:36): gotta remember",
        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:36): J4k3: I do use RG58 but with BNC connectors: maybe this is the problem",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:36): its not foil shielded",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:36): its like 95% metal braid and thats it",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:36): but you gotta remember...  RG58 was designed for CBs and other shortwave/vhf-lo activities",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:36): it worked nicely for ethernet (10 mhz), and the ethernet-grade stuff was made cheeeeeap",
        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:37): J4k3: isn't RG-58 good for wifi antennas?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:37): now there are good RG58... its called Times Microwave LMR-195",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:37): but it shares no properties with RG58 except for the outside diameter :P",

        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:37): J4k3: so what's your final advice for cabling? (1) cable? (2) connector?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:38): for 1M?  I'd say LMR195 or LMR240-UltraFlex and either N, TNC or SMA connectors (in that order)",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:39): RP-TNC and RP-SMA are most commonly used with wifi stuff, but thats for FCC compliancy reasons.  If you're not reselling the gear its not an issue.",
        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:41): J4k3: fucking shop! They only have RG58 and BNCs :-D they are totally useless :D",

        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:42): J4k3: btw, I must use at least one reverse-SMA since required by my AP. On the other side I'll use an N-type \u201a\u00c4\u00ee I've just built a vertical collinear antenna made up of 4 elements and 4 coils",
        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:43): J4k3: yes, there's not too much in my small town",
        "42d6c5f931e29a47ba58bd6531b21cb8 (14:43): J4k3: so, do you buy from the Net?",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:43): I've pushed 2.4 over radio shack's RG8 (95% braid, no foil)... it &quot;worked&quot; for about 30 ft",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:43): yeah, I usually buy from wlanparts.com or titanwirelessonline.com",
        "a20c00215ff91bf327808fcf6d1b00bc (14:44): titan because they're close and cheap on a lot of the stuff I buy, and wlanparts.com cuz they've got hella selection and they're *really* cheap on some stuff.",
