        "bc93facddc22279b39129c4879afacce (02:26): yeah ^_^",
        "984724c86e0fca843250d6eda9056728 (02:26): Maybe you should slightly tone down your expectations?",
        "bc93facddc22279b39129c4879afacce (02:26): I don't wan't to make a full world just yet tho &gt;_&gt;",

        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (02:56): can anyone tell me how to use the setMaterial() function ?",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (02:57): it gives this error : &quot;must use valid list&quot;, altough im passing the actual blender material list as argument...",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (02:58): and, if im passing a list, how does the function know the index of the material i want to use for a certain object?",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (02:59): not 100% sure.. but i think it may be the variable you are using is of the wrong type?",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:01): i\u00a5ve passed the blender material list as an argument... i got it with this : Blender.Material.Get()",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:01): so im sure its a list...",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:02): there must be some trick here...",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:02): i am unfamiliar with the function  .. but do a &gt;print type(argumenthere)",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:03): &lt;type 'list'&gt;",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:04): ok",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:05): its strange...have you used this function before?",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:05): .. the only other thing i can think of is that i have run into some instances where i had to pass arguments around to variables to get things to work correctly (probably due to my mistakes, but nonetheless) perhaps it could be something like that?",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:05): no i have never used it",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:06): ill try...but there's really something strange: provided that there is no error in the argument, how does the function gets the rigth index of the list?",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:06): maybe there is another way to do what i want",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:06): do you have a link to the function?",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:07): i want to change an object\u00a5s material",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:07): how can i do it?",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:08): link? im sorry but what link?",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:08): i really do not know how to do it",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:08): link to the function?.. the one you are asking about",

        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:12): i see the script materializer uses the function .. maybe take a look at how it is being used there?",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:13): materializer? i dont know it...",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:13): can u plz give me some link?",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:13): eg syntax on line 424 &gt;mat = me.getMaterials()[0]",

        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:16): looks like they are defining some things ahead of time .. maybe using that method will work? *dunno*",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:16): hmmm...ive noticed something...when you use the index, eg getMaterials()[0], the type is not a list",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:16): its a 'blender material'",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:17): aha",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:17): it should be a list (an one element list)",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:17): but u were rigth about the type",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:18): ill check the script now..",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:18): good luck. maybe try to ask again later.. you may get someone with actual knowledge about how it works.",
        "bdabd0d7c41fba410105b807464796e9 (03:20): i hope i\u00a5ll find it on this materializer script :) but you\u00a5ve been great. thanks a lot",
        "5c1aae219a1c363058128e55aab3fdd5 (03:22): no problem :)",

        "83b38c4cb528be59691e9a0ee2d2e8bd (03:49): A temp fix is the manually rotate the thighs but that should happen automatically, no? ^_^",

        "77a274a60caad728c4c99df0c2654e3f (03:51): ok",
        "984724c86e0fca843250d6eda9056728 (03:51): I.e. max files are not really files but memory dumps of the max scene.",
