        "b2cba13dca9931fada92f4cf76a5ffbb (00:53): is it the article about the two different html5 specs?",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (00:57): CNet seems more likely",
        "b2cba13dca9931fada92f4cf76a5ffbb (00:57): thats what I was saying :)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (01:14): in the whatwg we've already moved on from html5 -- if you look at the spec you'll see it talks about &quot;HTML&quot;, not &quot;HTML5&quot;",
