        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:27): When used for a dozen ASCII letters, a font like Gentium goes from 260KB to 25KB, of which 13KB is the licence text",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:29): and annevk's big-noodle-titling goes from 26KB to 8KB, of which 4KB is the licence text",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:30): (I've probably got lots of bugs that break kerning and everything, though)",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (21:35): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: wouldn't it be safe to serve a gzipped font unconditionally without conneg?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (21:35): presumably that would take care of the license text",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:36): With gzip, it's 3.5KB for big-noodle-titling and 11KB for Gentium",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (21:38): I want to try how hard it will be to use Linux Libertine, MgOpen Cosmetica and Libertine Mono with @font-face with strict license compliance",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (21:39): i.e. providing full corresponding source code",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (21:40): Removing the copyright text and using gzip, it's 2.7KB and 7KB respectively",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (21:45): so the crawler would need to be CSS-aware",

        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (21:54): TTF fonts have an &quot;installable&quot; bit",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (22:06): it the same with copyleft licenced software. You don't need to distribute the source with the binary, just make it available to those who want it",
