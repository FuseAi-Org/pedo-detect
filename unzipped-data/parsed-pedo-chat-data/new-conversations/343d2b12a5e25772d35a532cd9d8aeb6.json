        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:32): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: what happens if you have implied &lt;mi&gt; and then add a &lt;mi&gt; element?",
        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:32): or just change mi?",
        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:33): or change msup",
        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:33): (i can imagine several different things, all of which are pretty confusing)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:35): how do you mean?",
        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:36): like in your example http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Equations_in_HTML",
        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:36): if i add a &lt;mo&gt; element to the first mrow from script, what happens?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:37): you mean like you change the markup to &lt;math&gt; x &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;mfrac&gt; ... ?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:37): it wouldn't make any difference, the markup is equivalent",
        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:37): say you start with &lt;math&gt;x =&lt;/math&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:38): oh you mean through DOM manipulation?",
        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:38): right",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:38): the elements would all be there in the DOM all the time",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:38): the parser would insert them",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:38): like it does with tbody in tables",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:38): if that's not what you meant, i'll reply when i get back from dinner",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (04:38): gotta go",
        "d84728437bac6bc18af69cfdd57bff63 (04:38): thats weird though isn't it?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (04:39): implied elements are weird",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:54): Implied elements mean we don't have to check if there's actually a tbody present. Then XHTML comes along and ruins it",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (04:54): when I author a document, I expect the markup to be represented in the DOM just as I wrote the markup",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (04:55): if I could rely on that, I wouldn't have to do screwy tests to find out what the DOM thinks the markup should be",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (04:55): so the author ends up having to do extra tests",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:55): Implied elements are predictable",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (04:56): to expert authors, probably so",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (04:56): but most authors are not expert",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (04:57): I prefer wysiwyg DOM parsing",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (04:58): Hypothesis: Most authors either use .tBodies[0] because they were told to, or use getElementsByTagName('tr') and don't care about the tbody",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (04:58): I suspect most authors don't even know &lt;tbody&gt; exists",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (04:59): Everybody always includes &lt;html&gt; and &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; even though those could easily be omitted and implied",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (05:00): so it seems people don't understand the concept of implied elements to an extent that they intentionally make use of it",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (05:00): I say, the less voodoo the better",

        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (05:02): why would I not include an &lt;html&gt; element?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (05:02): I would expect and hope for an error if I tried to do that",

        "952fcd570c09b3137446717c00bcbdd6 (05:07): They could be the same right?",
        "227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6 (05:07): well, obviously you'll get no argument from me there, but I wasn't talking about SVG (for once)",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (05:07): There's nothing preventing you from making implicit elements explicit",

        "952fcd570c09b3137446717c00bcbdd6 (05:10): ... otherwise we end up with bits of SVG and MathML that only work in text/html",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (05:10): I would expect that anyone able to understand mathml well enough to write it by hand would not be confused",
