        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:32): For now, I think it's just &quot;use mercurial if you want&quot;.",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:33): i don't find any css repos at https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:33): Not yet, no. There are some fx repos, though.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:33): Including one of the versions of the combined Transforms spec.",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:33): i'd like to switch cssom editing to hg",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:33): Go ahead and do it, then.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:34): Particularly if you can use one of the tools that imports history from CVS to Hg.",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:35): should i create a separate cssom repo or a css repo or ???",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:35): The current practice seems to be to do a separate repo per spec.",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:35): not sure i have/need any special privileges to create repo there, but haven't tried",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:36): dunno",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:37): i notice there are a number of &quot;wg&quot; oriented repos, e.g., html, webapps (tests), pfwg, etc",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:38): i'll attempt to create a generic cssom repo that can hold all of the cssom related specs",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:39): it can be migrated into a uber-css repo if that is desired",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:39): any objection?",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:39): Not from me.",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:40): 3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62: ping MikeSmith about getting a repo created on that server, he can likely do it",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:40): We didn't really decide about one repo per spec or one repo for the WG, I'm leaning toward one for the whole WG",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:41): if you need help capturing the CVS history let me know, I have some experience there",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:43): yep, i would tend to agree it better to have a single css repo, with subdirs for specs, tests, etc",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:43): except tests go into the repo at https://hg.csswg.org/test",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:44): i notice many existing tests under html, webapps repos, etc already",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:44): webapps repo is mostly test subdirs",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:44): Yeah, but we have a specific test system for ourselves.",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:44): we have a number of tools that interact with the repo on our server",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:45): since it's hg we may mirror it at dvcs.w3.org someday, but for now, it's just ours",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:45): FWIW, I admin that server, I can easily setup a repo for our specs there too",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:46): i can",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:46): when the rest of the w3c syncs with our testing tools, then we may move entirely to dvcs.w3.org",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:46): ok",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:47): they use a version of our harness now, but haven't adopted the build and Shepherd systems yet",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:47): so, would suggest a hierarchy like css css/cssom css/cssom/{core,view,values} etc? or something flatter like css/{cssom,cssom-view,cssom-values,...}?",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:48): I like flatter.",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:48): 0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695: any opinion?",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:49): I don't feel too strongly, I tend to favor hierarchies. We can always adjust later if it becomes a problem either way",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:50): Give some thought to future levels of the specs too. Make sure it makes sense down the road.",
        "171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39 (00:51): Hm, good point.",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:54): one route would be to simply maintaiin the current cvs hierarchy: csswg csswg/cssom csswg/cssom-view",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:54): but we could use the transition to hg to introduce a little more structure, at the cost of doing it differently",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:55): My suggestion is to first convert the CVS reop to hg as-is, maintaining all history. Then in hg move directories about to suit.",
        "3c784bff199ef62ecc2f3a988f395c62 (00:56): sounds good",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (00:58): You probably want to get an empty repo on the server first, and clone it locally so you have the same repo ids and won't run into issues pushing back later",
        "0727cf52ad9f560d45e18372943ed695 (01:04): 171db427cee236fc04af9e5de94e7c39, 227a9a17d1db3f8e5c71a150345fb2a6: seen this? http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP8619",
