        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:34): wonders why a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d is so hung up on aria when there is agreement that aria will be included in html5 just as soon as the interaction with other parts of html5 is defined",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:34): and ARIA itself is defined in implementable terms",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:35): And when several &quot;whatwg&quot; people spent a great deal of effort making it possible to implement aria",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:35): (in HTML)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:36): 2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de: That's roughly the same thing. But there is an aria taskforce thing",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:36): yeah dunno, maybe because the TAG used it as example",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:36): and he's obviously been reading up on what happened so it might just have come from that debate",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:37): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea, I'm not really sure it's the same; defining how ARIA interacts with HTML and how ARIA maps to platform accessibility APIs seems quite separate",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:38): 2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de: Well it's kind of a subset I guess. Define how aria maps to accessibility apis, define how html maps to accessibility apis and define precedence and you can infer how aria fits into html",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:40): Who is doing the aria work?",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:41): not sure",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:41): hasn't been following it",

        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (10:50): is supportive",

        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (10:51): definitely not falling through the cracks",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:51): well, I meant the ARIA mapping to platform APIs",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:51): a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d: regarding your document, I think there are pretty clear plans to integrate api in html5",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:51): though someone from Microsoft was leading that too, I recall now",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:52): But it is blocking on aria being defined in a sutiable way",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (10:52): aria is an exemplar, those that worked on it have worked well with those that are leading html5",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (10:52): other groups (e.g. RDFa): not so much",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:53): ARIA was quite a tough sell actually",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:54): ask hsivonen",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (10:54): I watched it from the sidelines",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:54): they seemed to care more about XHTML2 than HTML at various points in the discussion o_O",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:55): I believe integrating aria into HTML5 is blocking on those issues being reslved",
        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (10:55): ARIA is in last call... perhaps somebody should raise such issues?",
        "2c39bccd623947fa6224ea57d2a727de (10:56): the PFWG wants to address those in separate documents",

        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (10:57): My read is that those that want ARIA want it in HTML5, and view being in a separate document as somewhat suboptimal",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:57): who are &quot;those that want aria&quot; in this case?",
