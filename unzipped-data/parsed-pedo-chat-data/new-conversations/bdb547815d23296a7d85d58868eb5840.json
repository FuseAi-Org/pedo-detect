        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:19): hyv?\u00a7?\u00a7 iltaa",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:21): I love umlauts.",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:28): those aren't actually umlauts, but separate letters ;)",
        "020b48854d7db62a6e68871c72d26e49 (18:30): letters with umlauts?",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:30): ?\u00a7 is a letter itself",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:31): what is the pronunciation effect of two of them?",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:32): You mean having two ?\u00a7-letters? It is just longer sound",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:32): Finnish is easy to pronounce",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:33): is it pretty much speak out each letter?",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:33): like Russian",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:33): yeah",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:34): that's nice. What about grammar?",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:35): well, you can put words almost in any order, so it is easy.",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:36): but picking up the right form of some word can be tricky",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:37): If I trust one source...it says there can be 2253 different forms of every noun",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:37): sounds about right",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:37): o_O",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:38): but there's logic to that, right? You don't have to just memorize?",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:38): yeah, there is quite simple logic",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:39): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_morphology#Noun_forms",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:43): ah! very similar to Russian: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_grammar",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (18:44): annevk, the test bugs in surroundContents are due to changes in testharness.js after the test was written, which are in turn due to spec changes.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (18:44): fixes",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (18:45): e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024: your letters make that all hard :)",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:45): :)",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (18:46): annevk, hmm, so we throw InvalidStateError for two things in surroundContents?  That's not good.",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:47): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: do you have somewhere spec'd how window.getSelection() reacts to selections in iframes?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (18:48): e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024, seems not right now, no.  I think I have feedback asking me to look into it, which I plan to do.",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:49): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762: cool. I'll just write up something that makes sense for shadow DOM (which is a similar situation).",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (18:49): e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024, I think the current theory is there's one selection per window, so iframes have a different selection.",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (18:49): ah, so it's not similar.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (18:50): annevk, pushed a fix to the test bugs.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (18:50): Or not?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (18:50): Oh, right, the fix isn't approved.",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (19:03): is amazed how www-style can have such a long and silly discussion about using forums",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (19:05): yikes, why is getSelection on both window and document?",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (19:05): historical reasons?",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (19:06): probably",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (19:06): &quot;&quot;Deprecated method document.getSelection() called. Please use window.getSelection() instead.&quot;&quot; was added to Gecko 2001",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (19:07): I think that warning has been removed",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (19:08): maybe 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 knows",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (19:09): Until a few months ago, Gecko implemented document.getSelection() as returning a string, but now I think we have interop.",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (19:09): Apparently document.getSelection has been in Gecko since 1998, so it could be Netscapeism",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (19:10): Yes, I'm pretty sure it dates to Netscape.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (19:10): Maybe it was originally on Document only, but then people realized it made more sense on Window.",
        "e9fe2a8ed6a64844a5c024b6f688d024 (19:12): fascinating",
