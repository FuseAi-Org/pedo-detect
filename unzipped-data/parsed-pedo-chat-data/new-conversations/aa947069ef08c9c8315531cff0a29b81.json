        "4c0c1d3d8ba815641ce1621584193537 (02:11): We recently moved out MySQL databases onto their own partition (mounted at /var/lib/mysql), so we could back up the databases at the partition layer. Now MySQL sees the ext3 filesystem's &quot;lost+found&quot; directory as a database, which is wreaking havoc with our maintenance scripts (as you might imagine). Is there a good solution for keeping databases on their own partition?",
