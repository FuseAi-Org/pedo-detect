        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:06): It doesn't answer the question I asked on IRC during the telcon: does 'border-radius: 40%' create a quarter circle or is it the same as 'border-radius: 40% / 40%'? :-)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:07): Ah, you mean &quot;If there is no slash, then the values set both radii equally.&quot; is ambiguous?",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:07): Minor: the word &quot;length&quot; should be removed from a few occurrences in the the first para. It is not necerrily a length any more.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:08): Yes, equal percentage? or equal value?",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:09): Also: computed value is probably &quot;absolute length or specified percentage&quot;",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:10): Hmm, not literally that, but something like it, in plural.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:12): I think I prefer to make a single percentage make a quarter circle (and the percentage is a percentage of the width). You can always add a second percentage to refer to the height, but you cannot otherwise get a quarter circle.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:16): That's really confusing, imo.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:18): What's more confusing: that 'border-radius: 1em' makes a circular arc and 'border-radius: 5%' does not? or that 'border-radius: 1em' is the same as '1em/1em', and '5%' is not the same as '5%/5%'?",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:19): I think it makes little difference, but the latter is more powerful.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:20): (On the other hand, why anybody would use percentages, apart from 50%, I can't imagine. It makes the corner unpredictable and different for each box and/or each window size.)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:20): The latter is more confusing to me.  The former seems sensical; all the border-radius components are 1em, or 5%.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:21): You thinking what I'm thinking, bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65?",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:21): Non-circular corners are very rare.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:22): Eh, not sure. What are you thinking?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:22): % always refers to width, but border-radius can take a keyword value instead of its list of numbers, with only one current keyword - 'oval'.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:23): I had that thought, yes. It's simple. But are we sure that's really the only case H?\u2022kon needs?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:23): I'm not sure.  I know it's by far the most *common* case in what Hakon needs.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:23): We'd have to ask him if that's sufficient.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:24): Of course, we also have to make sure it works for border-image.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:26): You mean: Brad may have a different case in mind where he needs percentages?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:27): Yeah, and I agree with him that the two cases should work the same.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:27): So lock Hakon and Brad in a room and let them hash it out.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:29): Well, in that case it's easier to just keep the percentages. :-)",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:29): (After we remove the ambiguity of a single percentage.)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:29): Bah.  Surely international travel costs can be justified!  This is SCIENCE we're talking about here!",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (01:42): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: Actually, it's ENGINEERING",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:42): Still a discipline of SCIENCE.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (01:42): Nope",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (01:43): Engineering uses knowledge to pursue design. Science uses design to pursue knowledge.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:44): These pitiful details interest me not.  I'm off to SCIENCE something!",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (01:44): heh",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (01:49): bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65: ok, fixed the length-&gt;value thing",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (01:49): bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65: also tried clarifying that the second percentage is copied form the first",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:54): So no way to make a circular arc with percentages then?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (01:54): as the spec currently stands, no",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:55): Well, is there a use for that outside of lozenges? (Boxes with half-circles)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:55): Because lozenges can be done no problem with the giant length hack.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (01:56): looks forward to css4-background, where we can have border-corner-shape: slanted",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (01:57): The word lozenge is ambiguous. Like H?\u2022kon, I interpreted it at first as diamond, not as pill-shaped.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (01:57): Mac-style buttons, then.  ^_^",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (02:00): The question can be reversed: is there a use for corners whose shape varies with the height of the box, but are not quarter circles?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:01): You mean beyond ovals?",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (02:02): Yes, I mean that the x radius stays constant while the y radius varies with the height of a box. (Because boxes vary much more often in height than in width.)",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:02): I can imagine wanting percentages against the height for things like buttons",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:02): that tend to vary more by width",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:02): Nod.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:02): or tabs",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:03): Buttons tend to be squat and vary in width, as opposed to the average CSS box.",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:03): In that case you'd put a percentage agains the height and a fixed length against the width",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:03): I think we'll see that a lot for tabs, actually, now that I think about it",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (02:05): But other than what may be common or not, my main argument is that taking a single percentage to mean equal radiuses gives more funcionality. You can always write two perentages, but you cannot otherwise get circular arcs.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:05): I agree that it offers more functionality; that can't be argued.  I'm arguing that that's confusing, and think that the extra power granted by it isn't enough to offset this confusion.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:06): (And, just for clarification, you can't get circular arcs *that are based on a percentage other than 50% of min(width,height)*.)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:06): (As the giant-length hack can give you the 50% case.)",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (02:07): My first thought was that it was confusing that a single value did *not* give me equal radii on all sides. By now I don't know what's confusing anymore. It's all equally non-memorable. :-(",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:07): Yeah, possibly.  Push to %h and %w units, and we'll be dandy.",

        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:08): we just need some keywords",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:08): border-radius: 50% width",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:09): And the lack of a keyword indicates that the % refers to the correct side in context?",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:09): right",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (02:09): Why do you say that you can't get circular except with 50%? In my interpretation of single percentages, *every* single percentage gives circular arcs.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (02:09): (Yeah, %h and %w are a horrible idea anyway, as they'd make circular dependencies ridiculously easy.)",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:09): you have to pick something to reference",
        "3f21e54c5c5ffd50fe3680acc025bb1d (02:09): either width or height",
