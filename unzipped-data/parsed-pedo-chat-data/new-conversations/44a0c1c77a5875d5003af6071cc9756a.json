        "32205af9be8690859c7fdecfa48db1fd (13:49): Because the AV data is corrupt there, and every time that account logs out, it keeps flooding me with warning msgs.",

        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:01): Since I have a computer that can boot from CD I took the hard drive from my other computer and put it in the cd bootable computer and installed windows 98 on it since it can be moved from computer to computer with no issues and the windows xp cd can start the install from within windows so it bypassed the need to boot from cd.",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:02): I clicked on the wrong option apparently because Windows XP installed on my other hard drive (I have two hard drives in the non-cd bootable machine) and so now I have two complete installs of Windows on two different hard drives... 98 is on C drive and XP is on D drive",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:05): Otherwise, just wipe out the 98 disk and put the bootloader and boot sector on the XP disk and live with the fact that it's called D",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:07): Yeah, make the partition active as well, do fixmbr (probably not necessary as the MBR will be OK as it is) and fixboot, and copy ntldr, ntdetect.com and boot.ini from the 98 disk to the XP one.",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:08): And edit boot.ini as necessary.",

        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:08): I've already done a search... it's sorta hard to find an answer from a database when you're in a unique situation.",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:09): Perhaps a better approach to doing this anyway would be to do the text-mode section of XP install on the CD-bootable machine and then before it goes into GUI mode transfer the disk into the other machine.",
        "fb4dbbe2a70f6a0a0eaa10dead26c669 (14:09): you could have done stage 1 install then swapped the disk over",

        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:15): let's say I have 15gb of files I need to store and each disk on the file server only has 10gb free... that means that I have to split the files up and then later remember than i did split them up",
        "c01e287596d8d0bf8decfaee9613616a (14:16): personally i consider organising files easier than losing them but each to his own",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:18): well... is there a way for my networked computers (both on win xp) to see two shared folders on the same machine as one folder?",
        "ce8c259e2b7bef2f198e2acccca96efc (14:18): would you say an pplication is &quot;launching&quot;, or that it's &quot;starting up&quot;",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:19): I say an application is 'loading'",

        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:22): but you are in fact loading a program when you execute one",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:22): you are loading it into memory which boots it up. It also can imply loading a program into the clipboard for a copy/paste procedure.",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:22): 'loading' is far more versatile and far more common",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:23): how often in a video game, for example, do you see 'launching...' as opposed to 'loading...'?",
        "7daaa7423e17898ed678e8e1a0653ddb (14:24): in any case... anyone know if there is a way for one computer with a shared folder on two different hard drives can appear to have one folder when a computer on the network checks it?",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:40): Not really, it doesn't load any services, drivers, etc",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (14:44): I don't think any hacks would be significant, just a case of moving the dir and setting a few configs",
