        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (10:55): I found 2 issues in browser rendering that may be more of a spec bug than a browser bug",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (10:55): anyone here listening, though, before I dive in?",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:16): 232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d: Dive in first, get resonse later :)",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:16): *response",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:16): People read the backlog and respond asynchronously",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:17): Thinking SVG may be better for the SVG working group",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:17): but basically ... background position is not working correctly",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:17): when using background-image: url(file.svg);",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:18): and the last mention i can find in the archives is 2008 i think",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:18): in which browser?",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:19): my sandbox is http://www.standardista.com/sandbox/testofsvgbgimage.html",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:19): in Opera and Safari",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:19): both support svg as background image",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:20): sandbox is ugly, but i have just been testing diffferent stuff",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:20): the grey bar in that test should have a background image",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:20): but i can only call a background image the size of the current element",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:21): if the elmeent is 120px tall, i can only posistion up to background-position: 0 -119px to see a 1px sliver",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:21): even though the contents of the svg are taller",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:21): i didn't declare a height on the svg itself",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:21): i'll try that next",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:21): but seems like a bug either way",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:22): the only conversation i could find on the issue was this thread: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2008May/0025.html",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:22): wouldn't setting background-y of -60px and setting no-repeat cause the whole SVG to render outside the grey element?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:23): the Web Inspector certainly thinks those properties are set in Safari",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:23): the bg position is -60... it pushes the background image up 60 pixels, so the background image should start at ht e60px mark on the svg",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:24): -30 works - the image covers half the element, but gets cut off",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:24): how tall is the SVG's natural size?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:25): does it have one? (I guess that would be by declaring a viewbox?)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:25): did you try using -webkit-background-size?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:25): that should work to resize the image if you want to make it bigger and then reposition it",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:25): The natural height seems to be around 230px",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:27): i'll try that",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:27): it might be that it scales to the size of the element, unless you adjust it with background-size or something",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:28): it does, but sizing it isnt' helping",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:29): it does scale to the elment.... which is why i brought it up here.",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:29): seems like this needs to be either specified or explained in the spec. I didn't see it",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:29): there",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:29): Hmm",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:30): Sort of looks like the svg is rendered to fit the element's box, so when you background-position it upwards, the content that should be visible just isn't there",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:31): I would expect -webkit-background-size to have an effect",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:34): found the solution",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:34): the size has to be declared in the SVG",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:34): I'll go over the spec with a finer tooth comb to see if i missed that",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:35): and file a bug to add htat language in if i dont' see it",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:35): I'd say there's still a bug",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:35): if you refresh that link",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:35): it's working",
        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:35): It might be undefined how to size a svg with non-explicit size, but surely it shouldn't crop",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:35): oh, that is a no repeat",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:35): and i set the width to 600",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:36): it makes sense that the size of an image should be defined, so defining the size of the svg made sense",
        "232cfb8f6e3d3fc35eab68ea25c1777d (11:36): i just don't remember that being required in the spec",

        "4d2a769942601baa26f55634a8eb251b (11:50): Can't see how it looks in Safari here, though"
