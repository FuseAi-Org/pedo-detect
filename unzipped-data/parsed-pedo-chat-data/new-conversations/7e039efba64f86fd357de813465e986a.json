        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:43): Crazy telecoms related things number #3456 we just got PAYG mobile broadband with 3 to fill in the gap before we can convince someone to give us proper useful broadband. To buy time you have to log onto the website. To log on to the website you need a password. They supply the password by SMS. To get the SMS you need either a 3G Phone or a Windows laptop",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:43): because even though they have a OS X version of the client software it doesn't support the SMS feature",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:46): (Anyway their uselessness pales into comparison compared with tele2 who, two whole months after we first asked for a broadband connection and were told 2-3 weeks, finally decided that we had not been in the country for long enough and so were not entitled to their services)",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (13:46): heh",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:47): has anyone tested if nodeName returning in upper case in WebKit for HTML elements is a characteristic of the node itself or its owner document?",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:51): we only pay for 10/10 M, which is 32.90 euros per month. 100/10 M would be 42.90 euros per month",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:51): (incl. VAT)",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:52): That sounds roughly similar to Sweden. I think the UK is quite a bit cheaper (or can be)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (14:02): hmm. looks like HTML 5 defines the case folding to be dependent on the HTML documentedness of the document and not a property of the element nodes themselves...",
