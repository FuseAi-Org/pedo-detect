They encounter problems in their everyday life, or they hear about problems others encounter. When they get here, they try to articulate those problems (often jumping to solutions too quickly).

No one in this WG should have to jump through  extra hoops just to document a problem immediately.

However, it doesn't really serve much purpose. I agree with you about Unicode (I'm not sure why we need Windows 1252 either). However, someone must have a problem with Unicode. so they needs a solution that's not Unicode and not Windows 1252.

However, those characters that some theorists in a language institute came up with will help facilitate international languages. Maybe ASCII and English are the only things anyone should ever use, but I think its nice to know we have a standard that can support even the most obscure writing systems.",
