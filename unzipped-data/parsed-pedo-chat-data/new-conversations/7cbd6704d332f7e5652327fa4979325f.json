        "8c74153bb9ff74cea6df7610ffe4c0de (04:49): Forget it I found one.  Why it didn't show up in the last googleing, I don't understand...",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (05:11): there are exams?",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (05:11): is that like getting a drivers license?",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:17): yes, only harder",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:18): as far as how to practice, best bet is to just play around on a solaris box with the objectives next to you",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:19): or wait a few months until we get the e-practice exams on the website (although i think you have to pay to get access to them anyway)",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:20): There is free epractice exams on sun.com, although its only 10 test questions",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:20): ahh.. it is free?",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:20): you have to pay for the 100 questions ones",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:20): yah.. that's the one we're doing at the moment.  120 new questions",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:21): Sun should put out a Certified architect exam",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:21): ala redhat's RHCA",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:21): rodrick: funny you should mention that - we've discussed it at length on multiple occasions",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:21): Redhat Security Exam is insanly difficult",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:22): as it should be",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:22): its probably the hardest of the 5",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:22): the solaris 10 security exam is out now too (in the past few days)",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:23): we had one question in the security exam which 9% of ppl got right in the beta. and unless i'm mistaken, we left it in for the exam :)",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:23): there is about 25 or so RHCA's in the world and 2 of them are at my company :-)",
        "134e404a52298a19bac7c78d8a4c4c88 (05:23): hey all",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:24): the problem is that we want to do something hands-on (like the cisco one, dont know about the RH one), but sun just isn't kitted up for it",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:24): RHCA isnt hands on either",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:24): ahh.. so RHCA just means you've passed all 5 other exams?",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:25): yeah",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:25): Kinda like the MCSE :P",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:25): there is going to be a Solaris Developer certification thingy done in the near future",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:26): DataStream, RHCA is no joke though man you should see the security exam we've had CCIE's who found it very difficult",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:27): rodrickbrown: i dont use linux, but tell me, i ahve heard that with linux's volume manager, can you splitt mount points for raids?",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:27): is thats true",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:27): ?",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:28): snake was going on about it",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:28): what do you mean ?",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:28): i would love to write a hands-on exam, but realistically we just cant do it :(",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:29): IE so say you have a 100gig raid 5 (or whatever raid scheme) you can mount say 60% on one mount point and the other 40% somewhere else",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:29): yeah you can do that in solaris also",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:29): Doc yeah a hands on exam would be so cool :-)",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:30): rodrickbrown: i thought you would have to make 2xraid5's of whatever size",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:30): i didnt think you could splitt the mounts",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:30): soft partitions",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:30): exactly",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:32): Doc i could think of some really cool lab exams :-)",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (05:32): VxVM",
        "134e404a52298a19bac7c78d8a4c4c88 (05:32): does any1 know of a gre pseudo device for solaris... i am trying to get wccp working",
        "a151f5d5372661fd903498bc13d6098e (05:32): silk: yeah i was just talking about plain ol solstice",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (05:32): the -e flag i think",
        "b94b64cdc7796ce8d52431e9b935e2eb (05:33): cant remember",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:33): cwebber, I think someone ported gre driver to solaris but not sure how reliable it is",
        "134e404a52298a19bac7c78d8a4c4c88 (05:34): wonderful",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:35): I wouldnt advise it you might be better of waiting for the clearview project to finish",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:35): Sun's working on a native IP tunneling driver",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:36): just toss a layer 4 switch in front of your proxies",
        "134e404a52298a19bac7c78d8a4c4c88 (05:37): yeah that isnt an option",
        "134e404a52298a19bac7c78d8a4c4c88 (05:38): i may just have to forward all the traffic through port 80 instead of doing it right",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (05:39): no HA good luck :-)",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (05:43): ever had a hme nic not play nicely with a switch?   it drops packets like crazy, but when linked to another switch its fine... no drops",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:44): check duplex",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (05:44): the switch autonegs to 1/2 duplex on hme's but i forced the switch and the nic to be full 100...  all other nics are fine at full 100...",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (05:45): i don't see   hme1  on sunswift card having problems it just hme0",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:49): forcing duplex is evil",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (05:50): but the u2 is supposed to be my fileserver, a fileserver at 1/2 duplex is basicly useless",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:51): if it's negotiating at half duplex, it generally means that the other end is forced",
        "aa939d032327c8399cf2851d5b0201ed (05:51): both ends need to be the same - preferable auto, but if one is forced, the other needs to be too",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (05:51): both ends are forced",
        "0ef8ee0341311e56b8a0008754347fdf (05:55): offhand, I'd suspect there's something wrong with that switch, then"
