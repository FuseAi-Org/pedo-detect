        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:33): depends on the task",
        "10e5de620dad2ffd3ce2a46445407ce5 (14:33): :D",

        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:34): Basically if it needs to be repeated often, I'll write a script. If it's a one off thing, I'll do whatver is easiest",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:34): quux, domain users displayed in simplified users management from control panels are only because they are members of local groups?",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:35): pihhan, correct",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:35): if you take away the domain controller and look at the list again, often you will see only the SID",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:36): well",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:36): problem is i changed pdc software, and domain sid changed",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:36): after that, there are problems everywhere",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:37): Ah. No way to reclaim the old domain SID (unless Samba allows that somehow)",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:38): samba allows it of course",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:38): so basically all you can do is remove the old accounts from localgroups and add the new ones",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:38): but only 3.0 and higher, which is there now :(",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:38): allows you to manually determine the SID your domain will have?",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:38): well that i did",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:38): of course :)",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:38): we are at linux, configuration options never ends :)",

        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:39): i am missing verbose logs on windows workstations",

        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:39): server logs are not enough :)",
        "10e5de620dad2ffd3ce2a46445407ce5 (14:39): never are :| and you dont get groovy log.rotate options",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:39): as they are telling authentication sucessful, and windws does reject me .. :)",
        "10e5de620dad2ffd3ce2a46445407ce5 (14:39): heh",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:40): I know samba has a getsid thing, but where do you *set* it?",
        "10e5de620dad2ffd3ce2a46445407ce5 (14:40): ever try ntp",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:40): quux, yes",

        "10e5de620dad2ffd3ce2a46445407ce5 (14:40): i heard it was nice , my syntax might be wrong , i have never used it personally",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:41): you can change nearly whatever you want",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:41): for example machine trust password",
        "10e5de620dad2ffd3ce2a46445407ce5 (14:41): :) lightweight directory access protocol",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:41): but the question is specific. Where exactly do you set that?",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:41): but you have to know what is windows using, and that is i am not so skilled",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:42): net setlocalsid",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:42): if i remember right",

        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:43): should be domain sid same as domain master pdc, right?",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:44): pihhan, yes. FOr an nt4 style domain, all DC's share the same domain SID",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:44): urban, well, ldap is in apache2 common package present, played with some days ago",
        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:45): if you change the dc SID, I imagine you might have to do some sort of 'change sids for all user accounts and groups' command as well",
        "10e5de620dad2ffd3ce2a46445407ce5 (14:45): pihhan, try making your ftp use hyperlinks with multiple users , with the mysql auth and not get a headache",

        "5c25b7bfc49ce3ff8821c0ec86afa4b7 (14:47): subinacl would be the tool, since it can do registry permissions as well",
        "d58b3cba781c5d1eb45749bd0d385ba6 (14:47): i were looking for windows api to make something in c++, but its soo strange and that :)",
