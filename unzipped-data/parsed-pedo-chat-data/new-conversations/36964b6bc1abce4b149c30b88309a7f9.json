If I want to specify a string literal in javascript, which can contain almost *any* character (it's from user input), how do I do this? do I *only* have to escape quotes (i.e., if the string is John's, do I do var foo = 'John\\'s';)? What if the string contains &amp;? The w3c validator then complains about an unescaped entity, BUT if I DO htmlify the &amp;s, the &amp;amp; is ta",
