        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:42): (in winforms)",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:43): fairly sure the list you're binding to needs to implement IBindingList for that to work, StaZ[home]",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:44): I'd use BindingList&lt;T&gt; if I were you",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:47): oh kewl i'll try that",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:48): however, with BindingList&lt;T&gt; you need to handle the .AddingNew to support that scenario",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:48): @ StaZ[home]",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:48): another thing... i have a List&lt;&gt; again and a listbox, i set the listboxes Datasource with the List&lt;&gt; and when changes are made to the list, the listbox item doesn't reflect the changes, also, if i &quot;re-set&quot; the .Datasource, the .items  doesn't do crap",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:49): List&lt;T&gt; doesn't support change notification",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:49): Arild wouldn't that just call the CTOR of the list's subject?",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:49): again, IBindingList",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:49): I think it *might* do that by default",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:49): great i'll do some testing, thank you, master !",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:49): (respectfully)",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:49): but what if there is no public no-args ctor, for example?",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:49): heh",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:50): Arild hm... any class/struct has a default ctor no?",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:50): my classes doens't have one and i can still instantiate them",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:51): the compiler supplies a default public no-args ctor if you have no other ctors defined",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:51): the moment you define a ctor explicitly, there is no longer a default one",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:51): ohhh i see your point",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:51): good one",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:51): i'll try it out",
        "839bc7ed2771b6f3310f45a914979e59 (08:53): you can have many constructors",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:55): Whole lotta ctors",
        "839bc7ed2771b6f3310f45a914979e59 (08:57): lol Dr.House is a nice show",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:58): Arild if there's no public no-args Ctor, the gridview doesn't allow add-new",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (08:58): right",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:59): and the ctor seems to be called, first when initialising an empty result set, and after that, each time a &quot;new row&quot; gets the focus",
        "839bc7ed2771b6f3310f45a914979e59 (08:59): obviousl :)",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:59): `m0 well it could've been an exception",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (08:59): i think it would've been better, less &quot;search for the unknown _no-error-no-result_&quot;",
        "839bc7ed2771b6f3310f45a914979e59 (09:00): have you guys watched Dr House :)",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:02): one last question (for now) : my ListBoxe's datasource is bound to a BindingList&lt;&gt; and the display member is the property &quot;Name&quot; of the subject... what a strange idea... and i got a BindingSource also bound to that list which binds controls... in short  you got records on left and record description on right",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:03): so when a listbox item is selected, the Name can be changed by a bound textbox... what is not happenning here is the Listbox items doesn't reflect the change made to the name, which is the display member of the list box ^_^... though when i .add and item to the BindingList, the list box will refresh its list",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:04): so the question is : is there a way to make it auto refresh on changes done to the display member, OR if there aren't, what is the _proper_ way to refresh a listbox's item list",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:07): if there is a way... cause i don't see how to refresh this list atm, resetting the DataSource doesn't work, calling .EndEdit() on the BindingSource doens't do either",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (09:11): by entering a name directly into the listbox, you mean?",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (09:11): but that won't change the selected item in the listbox",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:13): no the name is bound to a textbox, the current selected item of the listbox has name, a color, a type etc. this all appears on the right... and there's the Textbox Name, and when  i change the name there (which is the same as the Listbox item text) it doesn't change it into the listbox",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:13): it will change it if i .add and item to the BindingList caus that causes a refresh of the listbox item collection",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:13): so i wonder if that can be automated, or how i can call this &quot;refresh&quot; in the onvalidate event of the textbox",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (09:17): hm, beats me at the moment",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:17): heh... no problem",
        "fdac86ac035fedc311ee9ad1076466ad (09:18): a BindingList has a ListChanged event... can i raise it? i don't see a RaiseListChangedEvent",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (09:19): you can derive from the BindingList and call OnListChanged",
        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (09:19): BindingList&lt;T&gt; is designed to be derived from",

        "52d6c3d9bac87ece3683eefd396af8f2 (09:41): I told you how to do the check, use the IsBlahNull() method",

        "56b1f27d8ccbf6734debaabfb3bb7d76 (09:43): DateTime does not have a IsNull method",
        "56b1f27d8ccbf6734debaabfb3bb7d76 (09:44): well maybe a static method, let me check",
