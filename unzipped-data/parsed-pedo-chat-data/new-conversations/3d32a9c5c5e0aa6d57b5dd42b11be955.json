        "a480104b0e570389c6f4284a88c7cd9d (18:57): if they both are essential, do the shorter task first",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:00): back to timestamps in the title attribute and the ALA suggestion for a new attribute...I just found a topic where I suggest custom attributes for this back in August 2007: http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=54804#54804",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:00): it was shot down by peers of the ALA author...nice to see how times change :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:01): The computer science approach is to make use of the understanding of real-time OS task scheduling algorithms, so e.g. if it's possible to satisfy your tasks with no more than 100% utilisation then you can use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_deadline_first_scheduling",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:03): (zcorpan has been suggesting data-dtstart=timestamp and suchlike for about as long, IIRC)",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:04): ALA article says: &quot;[...] a significant amount of work needs to be done to really develop a workable solution.&quot; That's already been done and it led to data-*, right?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:06): 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: That's a solution for associating private script-accessible data with elements, not for defining the semantics of elements",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:07): e.g. you can't write '&lt;span data-datetime=&quot;2009-01-01&quot;&gt;a few days ago&lt;/span&gt;' and have a browser extension that lets you click dates to add them to your calendar",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:08): because that extended browser would be non-conforming to HTML5",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:08): so it's not a solution to that problem",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:09): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, yes, that restriction would need to be lifted or softened.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:10): 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: That restriction is there for a reason, and it can't be lifted without addressing the reason for it",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:10): (The reason being that there's no mechanism for people to agree on the meanings of data-* attributes)",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:12): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, I imagine the mechanism would be the same as class values? So things like Microformats would move their class values to the part after the hyphen in data-* and UAs could choose to interpret them natively, or via add-ons.",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:13): they could be managed like rel values using a WHATWG wiki page, too",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:13): (For the logs, data-* attributes are here in the HTML5 spec: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:14): 42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9: HTML5 had a mechanism for providing specific meaning to certain class values, and that didn't work well and got ripped out, so it's not a good precedent :-)",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:16): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, I guess something ad-hoc and communally agreed, like the Microformats approach, will be more successful than a central registry, then.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:16): But I suppose what's likely to happen is than a Microformats-like process will emerge to define common meaning to some data-* values, and they'll ignore that it's abusing the spec and that there's no reason to think it's not going to conflict with other people using the same name",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:16): indeed :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:16): because the validator won't complain and it'll achieve their goals, so it's futile to try to stop them",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:27): ooh, ALA's live preview is nice, except it doesn't do linkification",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:28): hmm, it seems you can't make clickable links in ALA comments :| oh well",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:29): Maybe they haven't grasped the concept of &quot;web&quot; and hyperlinking yet",
        "42e76c77af424a4350ab0e3e3f6f2ce9 (19:34): hmm, commenting takes me to a slightly different URL than clicking the permalink for my comment",
