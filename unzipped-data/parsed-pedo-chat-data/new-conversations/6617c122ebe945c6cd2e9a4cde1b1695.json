        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:00): doesn`t this mean that you have two paths to the lun?",

        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:01): It has 4 paths, but every disk have that",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:01): For good redundancy",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:01): perhaps it`s storage fault",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:01): Nope",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:02): We've checked it on that site :P",

        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:04): I must be honest to say that I dont know that part too well. So I cannot answer it. im sure our EMC-consult knows",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:04): if it matters much I can check :)",

        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:05): Well",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:05): nmon and oracles monitor seem to collect info somewhere in the OS",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:05): and somewhere in the OS it's listing hdiskpower7 twice, hence it's duplicate",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:05): though, checking around wher eI can think of it to be gives me, well, only one entry",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:06): i would remove this disk and import it again",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:06): Not possible :)",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:07): It's a quite loaded production system :)",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:07): that`s the problem, anyway i`m not very familiar with EMC and its powerpaths",

        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:09): the odbm or whatever it's name is doesnt seem to have two entries either...",
        "bc8f54dff52291a787f381b9c1e810c8 (16:09): What type of RAM slots RS/6000 station has?",

        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:14): perhaps bad zoning on SAN..",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:14): Coques: aye, and it will only show up once",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:15): Coques: Really, I am 90% sure that the SAN is setup correctly, I cant ever be 100 percent, and we have a marginal there",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:15): but considering they run around 250TB SAN for us, they are quite used on setting it up :P",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:16): It's only on this machine, this disk is also used on anothe rmachine, no errors",

        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:18): or just oracle?",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:18): well, lspv wont show it twice for example",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:18): but somewhere where atleast both nmon, and oracles monitor thingie, looks, there it's show twice",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:19): I just need to find out where that is so I can figure why it's show twice there",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:19): i see",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:19): but i have no idea",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:20): you could try diag to check",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:20): check errpt also",
        "e45ab62daee7418dcc2c0c8b3fa3ef85 (16:20): maybe there`s duplicated entry in ODM",

        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:21): ahh, ODM, well, we've checked in it without finding anything",
        "057c22504989424f1bd1b0f14b4e8964 (16:27): diag doesnt seem to work on the SAN-disks",
