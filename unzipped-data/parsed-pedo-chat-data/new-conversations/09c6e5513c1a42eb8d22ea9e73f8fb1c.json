        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (17:51): Oh, then you just have to make sure it's well-formed, or else it will die with a fatal error.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (17:52): So it's kind of inconvenient.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (17:52): Probably easier to use &lt;object&gt; for now.  You can still have &lt;script&gt; inside the SVG file itself, as I understand it.",
        "d8441a460e8ac10414418e8e2c673ec3 (17:53): so HTML5 and XHTML use the same thing?",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:55): Yes, except it's not magic because you're following all the steps needed to make it work :-)",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:58): and you can put scripts in the outer HTML page, and have them manipulate the inner SVG page's DOM",
