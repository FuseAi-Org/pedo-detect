        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:04): yes",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:05): do you have a couple of years with at least 40 hours of free time each week?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:05): Hixie: Minefield says of whatwg.org: The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it uses an invalid or unsupported form of compression.",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:05): heh",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:06): hmm. Firefox works. perhaps someone broke HTTP-level compression in the latest nightly",

        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:07): where is this &quot;real world&quot; of which you speak?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:07): hehe",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:08): (a world in which specification writers walk as gods amongst men, perhaps? :)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:08): it's called WHATWG",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:08): hopes the CSS WG transformed itself to a more WHATWG-like group in a non-hostile way",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:09): very diplomatic.",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:10): I haven't been following what's going on closely enough but the CSS 2.1 spec certainly seems to have stalled. and it would be great if &quot;CSS5&quot; emerged from the CSS WG itself",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:10): I thought CSS 2.1 was supposed to be &quot;CSS5&quot;",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:11): in the sense of codifying existing behaviour and expectations",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:11): 73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642: exactly",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:11): shame it just shrugs when it comes to table rendering of course, but that could be fixed...",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:12): they seem to be mostly working on the spec and not on testing if it's correctly implemented and changing the spec if needed",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:12): the other problem, as Hixie indicated, is that little new stuff that is needed for web apps comes out of the CSS WG, if any",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:13): what is the solution?",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:14): on a tangent, I've always thought that WHATWG is more fond of JavaScript than CSS",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:15): the WHATWG is focused on improving the semantic and logical side of the problem",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:15): there was hope that the CSS WG would solve the stylistic side but that hasn't happened yet",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:16): time to revive JSS perhaps? :)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:16): there's also need for improving the underlying platforms, such as the DOM and HTTP and maybe the URL specs",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:16): 73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642, I'm working on a new a version of the CSSOM",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:16): what seems alarming to me is that Hixie as a CSS WG insider says there's a problem and I had thought that the CSS WG was the best functioning WG at the W3C. (this may be an awfully naive though, but that's what I though)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:17): s/though/thought/",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:17): hard to define &quot;best functioning&quot; I guess",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:18): well, let's say the WG whose output had the most World Wide Web relevance",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:18): doesn't consider Web Services, private XML systems, Mobile Web and Semantic Web to have that much World Wide Web relevance.",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:18): ah, not the XQuery or RDF working groups, then :)",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:19): in that case, only HTML and CSS working groups would be relevant, yes?",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:19): (and HTML was defunct until recently)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:20): 73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642: yes. (I was thinking of the pre-new HTML WG situation)",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:22): strange when you think of the importance of the web, that it's development is so anarchic",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:24): that's because if you want to move forward you need implementations",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:26): and no single vendor is responsible for the web",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:27): well, MSIE is mostly responsible for how people code their pages",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:27): although that has shifted towards other browsers now",
        "73c8ec97fe210f482d81a5f04e5e6642 (13:33): oh well, after the coming apocalypse I guess someone can redesign the web from scratch, and get it right",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (13:34): The same people who designed the apocalypse, no doubt",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:34): once we get perfect humans, sure",
