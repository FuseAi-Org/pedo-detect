        "555a9bca7a84717f688bf33e78142832 (11:27): after that you can take any of the others, or at least most of them",

        "66e3ea40cb76a44d1c7fc991444e4dcd (11:31): at first blush, looks like an interesting program",
        "555a9bca7a84717f688bf33e78142832 (11:32): the book for the ccna is supposedly excellently written",

        "555a9bca7a84717f688bf33e78142832 (11:35): you must be on the east coast... me too",

        "555a9bca7a84717f688bf33e78142832 (11:36): lol, I see... well I dont know exactly why, but it doesnt seem like the best way to me",
        "66e3ea40cb76a44d1c7fc991444e4dcd (11:36): well, you could lose money faster by stuffing it in the garbage disposal",
        "555a9bca7a84717f688bf33e78142832 (11:36): as for wireless consulting, that sounds much better, but I feel that I should at least get the CWNA before I try to get anyone to hire me",
        "66e3ea40cb76a44d1c7fc991444e4dcd (11:37): seems fair",

        "66e3ea40cb76a44d1c7fc991444e4dcd (11:37): it's nice to have some case histories, portfolio to point to, but a sheepskin never hurt anyone. Seems a bit more professional",
        "555a9bca7a84717f688bf33e78142832 (11:38): what about in the beginning tho, when your starting out, and you have no case histories",
        "555a9bca7a84717f688bf33e78142832 (11:39): and no experience with enterprise equipment like cisco, except for OpenWRT of course ;-)",
        "555a9bca7a84717f688bf33e78142832 (11:39): and I know thats way different, my openwrt is installed on a cisco based linksys tho :-)",
