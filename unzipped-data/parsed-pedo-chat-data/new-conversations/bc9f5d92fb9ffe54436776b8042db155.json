        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (21:56): +Q: i have a Duron 1000 MHz - what is the correct setting for CPU external frequency in the BIOS?",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:09): +hm...",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:09): +ACTION pokes StoneNewt",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:10): +you there? i have a raid controller question?",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:10): +how do i figure the right stripe size for me?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:20): +larger the stripe size the faster you read data sequentially, however the more data you have to read to get 1 bit of data",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:22): +if you have a large number of small files a small stripe size is the required solution, if you have few very large files you want a very large stripe size",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:23): +for video &amp; audio drives I tend to use a 512kb or 1mb stripe size",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:24): + for general use 64kb or 128kb, for OS 16kb or 32kb",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:25): +what qualifies as large or small here? &gt;10M? &gt;100M?",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:26): +and how much is the performance gain?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:26): +small under 1MB, large over 50MB",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:28): +depends what happens with the system access",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:29): +hm... i expect to have three kinks of files. &lt;100k, between 700 and 900M and 2G+, and little between these categories",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:30): + the more intence the access paturn the more impact the straying from ideal stripe size will impact performence",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:30): +all files are accessed more or less quially, but small files are quickly accessed anyway because of the small size, so i tend to choose a larger block size",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:31): +I'm guessing, image, avis and dvd images",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:32): +yea, that makes about 60% of the overall size",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:32): +what does?",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:32): +the avi &amp; dvd images?",

        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:34): +I assume you're not gonna have much multi-user I/O going on",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:34): +if that matters, because it is a file servers, files will usually be read entirely, not partially",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:35): +even reading a large number of small files in whole with a multi-user paturn stripe size becomes key",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:35): +when i put something on the server for others to pick up, the burst load will be 8 to 15 users",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:36): +limit should be 30 users, but then they are not accessing the same file",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:36): +and that will usually be larger files",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:36): +most of which will be pushed onto the larger files right...",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:37): +yea",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:37): +the small ones will likely be downloaded before the next access comes in on a fast lan",
        "1becfb88fded39b9b7b556e1ed9b611b (22:39): +larger stripe size 256 or 512kb I think...",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:39): +good",
        "a25f6aeebda527fcb200ddb2d73c1b85 (22:39): +the larges one i get offered is 256k",
