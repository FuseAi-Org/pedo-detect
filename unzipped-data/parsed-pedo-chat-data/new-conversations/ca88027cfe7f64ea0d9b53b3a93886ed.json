        "27b09da4ba36799a61813264b66764bb (18:26): Your local machine?  I don't know.",
        "336fa8306484b172db5a0b878f21d7aa (18:26): and",
        "336fa8306484b172db5a0b878f21d7aa (18:26): didn't we implement a working page file dialog? I remember using it.",
        "336fa8306484b172db5a0b878f21d7aa (18:26): I guess I will need to try it again, so I can close this bug.",
        "27b09da4ba36799a61813264b66764bb (18:26): Oh, yeah, something for pagefile would be helpful. I don't want to give my ros install like a whole bloat of RAM, when it can happily swap. ;)",
        "336fa8306484b172db5a0b878f21d7aa (18:27): Well, the &quot;happily swap&quot; may not be perfect, but I've made ros swap before.",
        "3a85baf862aa07580a26a42a5a81434a (18:27): RAM is better than swap",
        "3a85baf862aa07580a26a42a5a81434a (18:27): It's much faster",
        "336fa8306484b172db5a0b878f21d7aa (18:27): Thanks Captain Obvious",
        "3a85baf862aa07580a26a42a5a81434a (18:28): You're welcome",

        "336fa8306484b172db5a0b878f21d7aa (18:28): \\\\. and \\\\? must be similar (or the same)",
        "27b09da4ba36799a61813264b66764bb (18:29): Well, swap is okay, if the stuff being swapped out isn't needed.",
        "27b09da4ba36799a61813264b66764bb (18:29): And I wonder, what a bare running ros (no apps) needs 60MB for.",
        "336fa8306484b172db5a0b878f21d7aa (18:29): uh, it shouldn't",

        "27b09da4ba36799a61813264b66764bb (18:30): WaxDragon - If I give qemu less then about 62MB, ros usually frezzes with &quot;MM: Out of swap space&quot; or so.",
        "27b09da4ba36799a61813264b66764bb (18:30): ... when starting a cmd and a taskmanager or so.",

        "336fa8306484b172db5a0b878f21d7aa (18:31): It needs memory for the debug symbols",

        "27b09da4ba36799a61813264b66764bb (18:35): Modern OSes don't even load the complete executable into RAM, they load the relevant pages when the program jumps there.",
