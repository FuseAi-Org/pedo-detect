        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (19:58): make a testcase so that we can reproduce this :)",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:00): I'll upload the code",

        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:10): To clarify further, somewhere in the qbtgstreamerelement.cpp code you see these two lines:",

        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:10): I do see the text emit testSig in the console window",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:13): where do you call emitPadAdded()?",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:14): a few lines below that function",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:14): it's ugly code I know, but I was trying to find the problem",
        "6b55e519c123815cb01dee3df0e70cae (20:14): oh crap, it's because of macro stuff :(",
        "6b55e519c123815cb01dee3df0e70cae (20:15): ok, another question: how do I connect a slot I retrieved from QMetaObject::slotNames() ?",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:15): tbscope, are you sure you emit the signal AFTER you connect your signal to your slot?",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:15): i dont want to check the whole code..",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:16): chrisb7: good point, I'll have a look",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:16): yeah, check for that. :)",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:18): for test case: qDebug() &lt;&lt; &quot;connecting..\\n&quot;; after your connect line. then you will see",

        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:21): you know for sure that the slot isnt called? maybe the output isnt just flushed to console?",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:22): That's the problem. I don't know how to test this. I wish there was a program that could show signals being &quot;fired&quot;",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:23): but it's not only the output. If I add more lines to the slot (to make the sound working), it doesn't work either",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:23): hmm, weird",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:23): what is gst?",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:24): gst = gstreamer",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:24): but I think that no signal is ever being emitted in my code",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:24): probably a moc problem somewhere",

        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:25): no: gstreamer needs glib and llibxml",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:26): yeah only gstreamer wasnt installed here, it is merging currently",

        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:33): I hardcoded a ogg file though, so you might get a file not found error",

        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:42): yeah it would be easier for you and me making a short testcase ;)",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:52): I added a little test class, and this does work.",
        "162f19ff7c9e8ad8253654a5170b74ed (20:53): maybe it's impossible to emit signals from static functions",
        "4cb838f24a383782871990f00ff3f757 (20:55): hmm, possibly. static functions dont owned a class",
