        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:46): well it's only in internet explore",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:46): goto the contact page",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:47): if your resolution is high enough it won't scroll at all",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:47): the funny thing is if you view the contact page outside the frame there is no problem at all.",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:48): it seems to be the frames page itself thats making the bottom scrollbar appear",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:48): &lt;frame src=&quot;main_index.html&quot; name=&quot;mainFrame&quot; id=&quot;mainFrame&quot; title=&quot;mainFrame&quot; scrolling=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:48): :)",

        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:49): no dice",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:49): is fine in Opera too",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:49): yes and also in firefox",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:49): but not IE",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:50): well, the scrolling is there, since it has not enough space for the widest element in the frame",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:50): now, the widest may not be a visible element, it may just be padding or margin",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:50): I'd roughly think is user agent defauts",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:50): interesting",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:50): `zip @ ezgranny420",
        "c95720c193df40ce1618d1b00b040b42 (04:50): ezgranny420, zip: Start every stylesheet with this: * { margin: 0; padding: 0; }. You'll save yourself the confusion over quite a few strange element and browser spacing differences later on.",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:50): if you look at the source i have the margins set to zero",
        "8f12e8acf6f40c6047f6fdc6ff6dba06 (04:51): aah thank you for the suggestions",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:53): hello.. please, does anybody know about flash based discussion board(forum)? I mean, I dont want to talk there about flash, but I want my flash based site to contain forum.",
        "4b1bee0e40377c8094df2adb4ae9c6e5 (04:53): what kind of site do you have?",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:54): happydude, well, the site is not yet build",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:55): I develop Pocket PC software, and study flash for my site",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:55): I want to have forum there, but I dont want to jump from flash to html",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:55): the site will be pure flash one",
        "4b1bee0e40377c8094df2adb4ae9c6e5 (04:57): so your site is going to have limited accessibility",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:57): why?",
        "4b1bee0e40377c8094df2adb4ae9c6e5 (04:57): do you think everyone has flash?",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:57): based on what I have read, 95% of people have flash installed",
        "4b1bee0e40377c8094df2adb4ae9c6e5 (04:57): or wants flash?",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:58): yeah the site is going to be for game development... I would say it is acceptable to use well optimized flash site",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:58): and there might be html option too, but primarily, i wisth to have flash site",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:58): 95%?",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:59): that's some stat",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (04:59): flash doesn't install as standard default on most browsers, only browser I know of that installs Flash plugin right off the box is Opera in win32 only",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (04:59): yeah, last week I read Building Flash Sites for Dummies - an easy and fast introducition to Flash, and that book mentioned those 95%",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (05:00): ah I thought, flas is built into Microsoft's IE",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (05:00): I'd go as high as ... maybe 80%, not 95%",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (05:01): but a flash forum I'd think will be slow and as happydude said, not so accessible",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (05:01): yeah, maybe.. however, I am so amazed by flash, taht I wish to have my site in flash.. later I might to implement html too..",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (05:02): hehe",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (05:02): yeah, I understant what you mean, CommandPrompt. I hoped I can optimize the site well",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (05:02): sorry, I am not very experienced in this area, although I am well experienced in 3d and C++",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (05:02): IMO you're going in the wrong direction, html goes first, then you add flash in the markup to spice up",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (05:03): or I can create pure flash site",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (05:03): that's like saying, I'm amazed by PDF, I wish my site was one whole .pdf file",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (05:03): there is nice Swift3D that adds 3D to the site.. I would like tohave it..",
        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (05:04): BunkaiSK:  flash is like pepper, you use a dash on html, it works smoking nice, you put too much, you spoil everything",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (05:05): ah, I see.. indeed, take a look at this, and tell me please, if you like it:   <a href=\"http://www.moxiedisplays.com/auto_intro.html\">http://www.moxiedisplays.com/auto_intro.html</a>",

        "a0e4ec720a249a3e5162548adbcc8f4f (05:06): which I don't",
        "4b47749ae508972ccd6d01a108bbbdb0 (05:06): ah I see.. :-) you literally don't like Flash.. :-)",
