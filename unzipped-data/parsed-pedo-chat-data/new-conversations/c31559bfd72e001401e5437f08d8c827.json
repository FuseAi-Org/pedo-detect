        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (22:39): So is the argument here that we should put web video on pause for 10 years while stuff is developed?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (22:40): b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea: And now you're going to call me insane :P",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (22:50): It doesn't seem that way. &quot;It is well known that many experts consider it now feasible to standardize serviceable royalty-free codecs.&quot; and &quot;Google should get on board on this important trend, not undermine it&quot;",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (22:51): This also seems to show a misunderstanding of how patent trolls work: &quot;Contributing VP8 to a standards group with a strong patent disclosure policy would be a good corrective move; it would force lurking patent holders to come fully into the public.&quot;",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (22:51): Yeah, I'd just like to believe that.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (22:52): Truthfully he seems to be painfully naive.  I noticed that last one you quoted in particular.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (22:59): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, a strong patent disclosure policy like ISO, which produced H.264?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (22:59): Disclosure isn't the same as licensing.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (22:59): Yup, I think he has a mistaken idea of what it means to &quot;disclose&quot; a patent.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (22:59): Patent trolls don't join groups with patent licensing policies.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (22:59): It can mean &quot;Yup, we have a patent.  Have fun licensing it!&quot;",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:00): Even in a group like the W3C, anyone with patents could always refuse to join the Working Group rather than disclose or license its patents.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:01): Assuming they're a member in the first place.",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:02): But I read another thing somewhere else. What if someone came up with a patent that turned out to be essential to h264, and refuse to license it. Could they shut down everyone using h264?",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:03): Sure, in theory.  You don't have to license your patents to anyone.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:03): It's unlikely that they wouldn't accept whatever payout they were offered, though.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:03): Also, we could just have H.264a released really quickly to work around the patent.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:03): Plus there's H.265 one of these days.  So it wouldn't help much, I don't think.",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (23:04): Well, the concept was that someone would do it because they wanted to give open video a boost by shutting down the best alternative",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:04): That would be somewhat hilarious, actually.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:15): I submitted a comment to glidden's post expanding on what we're saying here."
