        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:10): Ooh, it even does &lt;canvas&gt;, except it seems to be based on an old version of WebKit that has some Canvex-breaking bugs :-(",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:11): plus the bug that means I can't run my canvas tests without it crashing",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:22): Hmm, doesn't seem to have any more problems than WebKit-OSX at canvas rendering, which is nice, though it's limited to the few bits I'm testing and to my memory of what bits WebKit always breaks on",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (22:32): http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/tests/tests/results.html - nothing interestingly different (unlike WebKit-Qt which applies much more creativity to its rendering)",
