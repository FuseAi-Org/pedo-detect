        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:09): But i do not think that matters much if you work with computers since years in lets say - just virtually all you free time?",

        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (03:11): They attempted to determine which module overclocked the best and stayed stable in the long-term, but their methodology was totally incapable of determining any such thing... it was as good as guessing.",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:11): qdot: i dont get you're point - what do you mean by &quot;what you're doing&quot;?",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (03:12): expose: well.. you could understand intuitively a lot about computers without proper education.. but if you want to know why k8's MHz are 'worth' more than Netburst MHz... than you get into ASIC design stuff",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (03:13): expose: things like OOE, prefetch, superscalarity, load/store dependency resolvers, microops schedulers, RISC/CISC, SDRAM/SRAM etc",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:14): i could explain your example problem for instance",

        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:15): I think i could. maybe not 100% accurate, and maybe i would lack some english translations but, well.",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:15): I could also build up quite some stuff using and/or/not gates",

        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (03:16): expose: oh-key.. that's pretty good for 12th grade.. still, probably insufficient to start talking about CPU pipelines",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:16): at least, if you chose the right courses.",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:17): well - netburst just has too much states. or whatever you might call that",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (03:17): qdot, I don't believe you need to have a formal education in these matters to appreciate them or to discuss them, although your breadth of knowledge will be smaller if you only have an interest in it without formal tutoring.",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:18): stages or something. they bloated the cpu too much, and clocked the fpu with doulbe clock rate, resulting in those huge hotspots",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (03:18): nah.. actually Netburst is a damn simple CPU",
        "a4687444fb35a0a63d65953dd342dfc4 (03:19): ...with very complicated performance statistics in some applications!",
        "e06589a0e2bd2d8b5ced22c7981928f4 (03:19): Well - they tried to fix that by using hmm well this prediction thing, whatever it is in english but it didnt work out",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (03:19): Xbit-MTX: I wasn't refering to formal education.. I was more refering to the difference between 'wizard-technician' and 'engineer' (even self-taught)",
        "eccc41dbf48c2aa93ec2e52bfb729e2e (03:19): what voltage would I need to set my amd 3200+ to to get 2200 mhz?",

        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (03:23): expose: actually, transistors don't care that much.. they flip at about 0.6V",

        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (03:25): no.. parasitic capacitance.. at higher voltage the same RC circuit will get charged/discharged quicker to the bandgap switch voltage (0.6V)",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (03:26): basically the gate considers &gt;0.6V as logical '1'",
