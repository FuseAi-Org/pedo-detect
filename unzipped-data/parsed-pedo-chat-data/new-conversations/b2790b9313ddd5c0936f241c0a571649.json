        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:16): jacquez: or to ask the question another way, why are you using XHTML 1.1?",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:16): I'm not sure I am using a template",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:16): is that reason?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:17): what template?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:17): (it's not necessarily a good reason, but it depends what sort of pages these are going to be)",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:17): most web work should be in html 4.01 strict or xhtml 1.0 strict",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:18): (which one is best is a matter of tedious and frustrating debate)",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:19): i certainly wouldn't recommend using 1.1 for public pages unless you have a special reason for doing so",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:19): as you can't serve it to IE users",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:20): (i will try and answer your accents question too, but it's important that you're using the right markup language first)",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:20): what sort of pages are these? do they include mathematical formulae for instance?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:20): where did the template come from?",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:21): oswd.org",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:21): no math involved",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:21): just foreign names and such",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:22): yeah ... you need to find a template for HTML 4.01 Strict or failing that XHTML 1.0 Strict",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:22): and that will fix my problem?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:23): it will save you from massive problems that you haven't encountered yet because your pages aren't online",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:23): what about with the accents and other stuff?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:25): jacquez: i haven't had to deal with the accents problem with XHTML 1.1 (i don't use it because it has little real-world application yet, as IE users can't access it) ... but i assume the accents situation is the same as in XHTML 1.0",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:25): you need to specify an encoding",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:25): in the xml prologue (with XHTML 1.1 only)",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:25): why can't IE users access it?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:26): and you need to specify a charset in a meta tag",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:26): and you need to save your document in your text editor as the same encoding",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:26): and basically the only encoding you want to use is UTF-8",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:26): (unless you happen to be doing work in japanese)",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:27): and to be double sure that users of old browsers can read your accents, you should probably encode them as numeric character references",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:28): a really quick way to find out the NCR of any character is to use this wonderful page: <a href=\"http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/uniview/conversion\">http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/uniview/conversion</a>",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:28): stick an accented character in the Character box, click one of the other boxes and they'll all fill up with their different encodings",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:28): of that character",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:28): you'll want decimal NCRs",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:28): so ?\u00a9 (e acute) is &amp;#233;",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:30): that is a lot of work",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:30): jacquez: IE users can't access it because, unlike XHTML 1.0, XHTML 1.1 cannot be served with a mime type of &quot;text/html&quot;",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:30): so what happens when they come to my site?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:31): because one of the key aims of XHTML 1.1 was to force xml parsing rather than html parsing of the markup",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:31): jacquez: i suspect (i haven't tried it) that IE will either try and download the file (not render it), or display it as XML",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:31): (i.e. display the markup rather than rendering it)",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:32): i changed everything to UTF-8 and the accents work",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:32): but please trust me: if you don't know whether you want to be serving XHTML 1.1: you definitely shouldn't be serving XHTML 1.1",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:32): jacquez: yes ... they should work fine in modern browsers",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:32): so I can chage the DOC type easily?",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:32): jacquez: it depends how much you care about people with older browsers, whether you also use NCRs",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:33): I'm not going to be using NCR's",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:33): for the most part",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:33): jacquez: if I were you (unless there's some special reason not to), I'd just go find a template designed for the doctype you want to use",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:34): if you do decide to try and adapt the existing template, the easiest, though not necessarily best, thing to do would be to change it to xhtml 1.0",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:35): although its substantial work whether you go that way or to html 4.01",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:35): because if you use xhtml 1.0, you need to follow Section C of the spec (in order to serve pages to ... you guessed it .. internet explorer)",
        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:36): hmm",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:36): basically xhtml 1.0 was designed so that you could write it in a way that IE could read it",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:36): XHTML 1.1 was trying to move beyond that entirely",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:36): HTML 4.01 is the simplest solution, because everyone (virtually) can read it",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:36): and it can always be served as text/html",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:37): but again, i'd say just go find a different template if you're not sure what you're doing",
        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:37): here's the HTML 4.01 spec: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/\">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/</a>",

        "c682ae2672d120269ea71d720dd72e7d (03:41): so does anyone use XHTML 1.1?",

        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:43): jacquez: mainly people who need to extend HTML (that's what the X is for) with other markup",

        "9e152197faf4c66d82eb897f8eaf0c00 (03:46): e.g. it came with the computer, it's what the organization uses, it's habit (people just plain like what they're used to and don't like change)",
