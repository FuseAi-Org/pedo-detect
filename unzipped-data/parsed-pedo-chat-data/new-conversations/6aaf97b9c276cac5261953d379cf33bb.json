        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (18:53): another media question -",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (18:53): I've been using the canplay event to say &quot;this is the time I should enable my custom controls&quot;",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (18:53): but sometimes the video download will suspend, so canplay doesn't fire",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (18:54): I'm thinking that I should enable my controls at the loadeddata event - would that be a better approach?",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (18:54): the user can then start the playback, which then eventually fires canplay (I'm seeing this in Firefox btw)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (18:58): I think that's the right thing anyway; iirc for some types of video (live streams?) FF will *never* fire canplay,",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (18:58): cheers - exactly what I was after",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (18:59): ta",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:01): ooh - one question tho -",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:01): the preload=&quot;metadata&quot; attribute",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:01): do you know (I'm trying to work out from the spec now) whether that will only fire the loadedmeta data",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:01): and not the loadeddata",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:02): because then I'd be stuck with no ui",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:02): so perhaps I could hook at the loadedmetadata instead?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:02): Not sure at that point.",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:02): Darn :-\\",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:02): I think roc is working on video in FF.",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:03): roc? Is that someone in here?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:03): robert o'callahan.  Don't know if he's in the room right now.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:04): still hasnt' figured out all of irssi's commands.",
        "ae98fa2c663c48bc37af8f7babbc1ffd (19:04): okay, cheers for that - I'll keep my eyes peeled :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:15): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: /names to see who's here, or just type their name and press tab and see if it autocompletes",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:16): Ah, thanks for /names.  roc has a short enough name that I thought perhaps robod was blocking him or something.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:18): Type in the whole name and tab-complete and it'll add a &quot;: &quot; if the person is here",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:19): Yeah, I guess that's true.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (19:19): or just the first few letters and tab will cycle through all the options",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:19): Ah, didn't know about the cycling.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:19): I just delete and type more if it doesn't hit the right person first time.",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (19:20): just learnt to use irssi by hitting random keys",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (19:27): hmm. WebKit closes stuff more aggressively on &lt;/form&gt; than old Gecko or IE do",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (19:27): I wonder if the spec should change to be like WebKit on &lt;form&gt;&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/form&gt;baz",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (19:27): anyway, I believe &lt;button&gt; shouldn't be scoping",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (19:28): bug that made me look at &lt;button&gt; and &lt;/form&gt;: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558302",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:29): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Damn you XML!",
        "5118b8399f69ec9afb5e3e54b6696bff (19:32): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: me? blocking? who? :)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:33): If roc was in the room, your name would probably come directly before him.  So I wasn't sure if he was actually not here or what.  ^_^",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (19:38): How would you describe the HTML5 ie problem?",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:38): The specific treats-unknown-element-start-and-end-tags-as-void-elements problem?",

        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (19:40): Hmm, looking to summarize what my script will do.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:40): I would describe it as &quot;IE treats unknown element start and end tags as void elements&quot;.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (19:41): Yea, yea.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (19:41): Hmm, so I'm describing it as &quot;IE Print Protector is a script that allows you to print HTML5 pages in Internet Explorer&quot; and I'll use what you wrote to describe the issue.",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (19:41): Thus making them impossible to style and they instantly collapse, spewing their contents into the DOM",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (19:41): Probably describe wtf that actually means to the page author, which is &quot;the unknown elements no longer wrap their contents&quot;.",
        "7cbd522d7fcf593a1e60d52c789b6a7b (19:43): Print Protector\u201a\u00d1\u00a2",

        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (19:57): No TM, 7cbd522d7fcf593a1e60d52c789b6a7b :-P I don't want anyone to think I somehow am a genius.  It will only give them reason to prove I am not. :)",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (19:57): &quot;Oh, I packaged this whole thing up for you, I wrote this script, look at me, I'm so cool&quot;",
        "7cbd522d7fcf593a1e60d52c789b6a7b (19:58): hahaha",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (19:58): We test it, make it look sexy so those who need it find it easily and merrily.",
        "70bfd0ae2cfbf2da192bddd569cf6132 (19:59): Like charitable prostitution"
