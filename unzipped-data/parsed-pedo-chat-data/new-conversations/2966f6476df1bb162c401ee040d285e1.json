        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (13:34): event propagation is different",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:36): so Indexed DB has some kind of hierarchical object model other than Nodes and uses event propagation on them?",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (13:36): web-dom-core tries to clearly define how even propagates, and that propagation certainly doesn't include Window",
        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (13:36): yeah, IndexedDB has  a tree or list",

        "6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf (13:38): but web-dom-core basically dis-allows Window in the event target chain",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:44): but that can be changed easily",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:50): I don't think it's too important, but it's more convenient to define them together",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:51): And since they're sort of fundamental to most things, it makes sense to me (and others I believe, you're the first to question it)",
