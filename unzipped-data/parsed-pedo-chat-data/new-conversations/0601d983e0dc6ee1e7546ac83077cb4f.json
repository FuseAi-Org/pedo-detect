        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (02:13): COM components rarely get referenced in an import table, so there's nothing to delay load; typically when one creates a COM component, the loader checks the register (or a manifest file) for the location, and does a LoadLibrary",
        "bd135b70010fdccd397f317ce1ca1392 (02:13): But how would I register the components then?",
        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (02:14): regsvr32 should LoadLibrary and then GetProcAddress on DllRegisterServer",

        "bd135b70010fdccd397f317ce1ca1392 (02:17): I called regsvr32 on the dll, and it said it worked, but what did it export?",
        "bd135b70010fdccd397f317ce1ca1392 (02:17): I mean does that mean it actually registered anything, or it just didn't find anything and had no problem",
        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (02:18): it means, literally, that DllRegisterServer returned success",
        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (02:18): what that function does is up to the component",
        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (02:18): typically, they'll register a type library, interfaces, and COM classes, to name a few",

        "94f6fe9e8f4c2f6177cb923a730b1759 (02:19): note that components usually use the module path when registering themselves, so the registry likely points at that location where you registered the dll; the component will be loaded from that directory",
