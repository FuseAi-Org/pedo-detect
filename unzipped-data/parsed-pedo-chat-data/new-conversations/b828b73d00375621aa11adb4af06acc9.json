        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:26): where should i look for it?",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:26): for Solaris 10 6/06? no.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:27): for the OpenSolaris ON bits, yes.",

        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:27): can i use that source for this solaris from sun",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:28): if i compile it can it work on this one?",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:28): oh ic ... i've seen that site before",
        "72bac19ca0a2ff15f99326a8f7e02c10 (04:28): The source that is released is not from Solaris 10, or Solaris 10 patches.  It's what will probably end up as Solaris 11. (Nevada).",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:29): well i wanted to compile it from source",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:29): no, you need to use a Solaris Express release to build from source.",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:29): oh ic",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:29): is there any particular reason you want to build, other than just curiousity?",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:29): (there's zero technical merit)",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:29): oh really",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:29): i just wanted to know what it was like to have to build it",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:29): from source",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:29): i guess its not important?",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:30): i have no particular needs to have a cust_kernel",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:30): jmonk_82: it'll have no effect on the overall functionality of your system.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:30): (often on Linux and other popular open source operating systems, you build from source for additional functionality)",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:30): thats true and im too lazy to remove what i already have installed here",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:30): Solaris is completely modular, and makes this action useless.",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:30): ah ic",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:31): i have a different question",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:31): when it comes to solaris from opensolaris.org",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:31): how are people installing that? its from source right?",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:31): i mean thats all i read about... and for the quick install i just go to sun and download",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:32): jmonk_82: you traditionally grab a Solaris Express release (which is a Solaris 11 beta of sorts, and thus based on the OpenSolaris ON bits) and compile the source bits from OpenSolaris.org and then install them.",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:34): oh okay",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:34): and source bits means the kernel?",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:34): no, source bits mean kernel+most of the userland",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:35): (excluding CDE, JDS, X11, OpenWindows, etc.)",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:35): and sfwnv (which is /usr/sfw), and probably 20 other things.",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:36): ah ic and what i have installed is the stable production release from sun?",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:36): yes",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:37): Solaris 10 and Solaris Express (Solaris 11) use completely different codebases.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:37): but often, because Solaris Express uses the OpenSolaris bits, sometimes features from Solaris Express (and thus OpenSolaris bits) and backported to Solaris 10.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:37): like ZFS.",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:37): i get it now",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:38): Sun didn't rewrite Solaris completely to create OpenSolaris, but rather just because something is committed to OpenSolaris does mean you'll find it in Solaris 10.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:38): doesn't*",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:39): oh okay they still keep a control over what they release in the stable non community version",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:40): a more descriptive way is to say the intersection between Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris is non-zero, but the intersection of the two does not neccessarily equal one or the other.",
        "72bac19ca0a2ff15f99326a8f7e02c10 (04:40): jmonk_82: Yes, but not exactly.",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:40): jmonk_82: basically.",
        "72bac19ca0a2ff15f99326a8f7e02c10 (04:40): The other side of the coin is that no doubt changes had to be made to facilitate opening the code.",
        "72bac19ca0a2ff15f99326a8f7e02c10 (04:40): As with anything else where code has been opened.",
        "72bac19ca0a2ff15f99326a8f7e02c10 (04:41): those changes happened after Nevada and 10 separated.",
        "72bac19ca0a2ff15f99326a8f7e02c10 (04:41): so 10 would not be naturally clean as far as such things go.",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:41): i hope they include the nifty nic code in the solaris 11",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:41): Solaris 11, on the other hand, will be using the OpenSolaris bits.",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:42): ic",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:42): do they plan to include nifty nic code into the solaris 11 or neveda as of now",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:43): thanks though i understand better how the community functions with regards to sun",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:47): are there any good tutorials online for learning how to admin sun... im from linux world",
        "42ea8224daa623d886ac98a3a7f81c60 (04:47): like learning about zones, zfs, etc",
        "53303ac79660a60ff15ef2ae2835996f (04:47): docs.sun.com is a good place to start.",
