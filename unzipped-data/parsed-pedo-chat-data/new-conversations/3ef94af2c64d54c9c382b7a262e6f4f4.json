        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:40): is it possible to plug a PCIE 1x card into a 4x slot?",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:41): yes",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:41): it is actually quite possible to do the opposite, too",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:42): it would just run at 1x rate?",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:42): uhm",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:42): and it's not 1x rate, rate is always the same, 2.5Gbps",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:43): basically, a PCIe is a bus of lanes.. and you can connect one or more of synchronous lanes to get extra transfer",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:43): sweet",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:43): now, they screwed up a bit with the power layout for the bus",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:44): but you can have something which looks like a 16x slot, but is in fact a 8x nus and rest of the connector is power only",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:44): hehe :)",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:44): try dremel first",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:44): lol",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:45): this new asus board I want, claims 16x SLI",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:45): yeah, probably 2x16x",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:45): but you can have some 'SLI' boards which split a single 16 lane bus in two 8lanes",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:45): this one apparently doesnt, &quot;true 16x in SLI mode&quot;",
        "d923d906582234f7da470514434fab8b (00:46): Is there a freely available benchmark/program to test the basic performance characteristics of these 1x - 16x cards?",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:46): and as far as dremel goes - I was quite serious about that.. if cards have external power connectors and don't rely on PCIe slot..",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:47): heh :) maybe one day Ill try for kicks",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:47): we built a machine here with 6 GF6800 cards - 2 running at 16x, 2 running at 4x and two at 1x",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:48): you have actually done it?",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:48): yep",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:48): haha",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:48): drivers get *nuts* in windows but linux handles it pretty well",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:48): nice",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:48): oh, next question",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:48): linux DOES support SLI (nvidia)?",
        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (00:49): would assume so",
        "623dd926daeac8b8f677b3848f119907 (00:49): (i personally thought sli was bios)",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:49): Inssomniak: somehow...",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:49): Inssomniak: still pretty buggy, but yeah",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:50): Storkme: no.. actually BIOS has close to nothing to do with SLI",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:50): Storkme: it's video drivers convincing separate cards to do combined rendering into a shared framebuffer",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:51): Inssomniak: we didn't try SLI there... the entire system is a GPGPU node",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:52): GPwhat?",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:52): sounds like something ya'd install in an airport",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:52): pretty pointless..",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:53): general purpose graphics processing unit computations",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:53): basically using vector units of a GFX card to do some science",
        "5d3892c61a03c5b01b410b03954d1807 (00:53): ok",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:53): for airports, there are far better and costeffective ways to do it",
        "4141d939b8f0c7620a565468302ce151 (00:54): we just wanted 6 top-notch GPU processors in a single machine (together with some opterons and loads of RAM..)",
