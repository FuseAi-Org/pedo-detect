        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:48): does anyone know a html5 parser written in c that is reusable?",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:49): ideally one that can emit errors and warnings and as such used for validation",
        "73cf54d5a46ca56882c4ee523cf6b057 (15:49): err",
        "73cf54d5a46ca56882c4ee523cf6b057 (15:49): how do you determine if a bug is resolved or not",
        "73cf54d5a46ca56882c4ee523cf6b057 (15:49): I didn't even get a chance to respond to that and it's already closed..",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (15:50): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc, there's no standalone c implementation yet",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:50): 6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00: is anyone working on that?",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:50): and are there estimations about how complex that would be?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:50): there's hubbub, but I'm not sure how up-to-date it is",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:51): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc: I'm working on a C++ implementation that is Gecko-specific",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:51): basically i would love to see a live-html5 validator for firefox",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:51): there is a sgml validator already, but that one of course does not do the trick with html5 :)",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (15:51): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc, did you look into Validator.nu?",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:52): 6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00: that is quite complex to setup and requires java as far as i know",
        "73cf54d5a46ca56882c4ee523cf6b057 (15:52): how do you guys decide whether or not an issue in the bug tracking system should be closed or not?",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:52): and sending http requests there for everything does not sound like a good idea",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:52): i'm already using validator.nu as part of my testsuite though",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:52): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc: I plan to add parse error reporting eventually, but adding error reporting is at the bottom of the priority list, because it isn't needed for parity with the old parser",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:52): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: makes sense",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:53): the bugzilla entry is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=512229",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:53): also that stuff is localization-sensitive and so forth",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (15:54): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc, yeah, though b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 wrote a To-Mozilla-C translator of some sorts",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:54): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: i will monitor that",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (15:54): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc, and the idea is to use that new parser in Gecko in due course",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:55): isn't that one already in the nightlies?",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:55): at least there is a setting to enable a html5 parser",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:55): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc: yes",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:55): guess i looked at that one yesterday then",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:55): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc: the ground work of making tokenizer error reporting Gecko-friendly has been done but doesn't have Java-to-C++ translations support yet",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:55): unfortunately mozilla code still makes my eyes bleed. i don't understand that com stuff at all :(",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:56): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc: the ground work for tree builder error reporting isn't done",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:56): yeah. saw that",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:56): it's not doing anything with errors currently",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (15:58): the sgml validator extension for firefox was the only way i could keep the pages validated, because i just don't have the time to submit all pages to an external validator website",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (16:01): You could have an extension that automatically submits them to an external site and gives you the result almost immediately - would that be adequate?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:03): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc: having just an HTML5 parser doesn't give you validation",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (16:04): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: yes, but it's a good start for writing a validator",
        "4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc (16:05): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: would require a network connection and would slow down the whole thing a lot",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (16:05): 4ed4a4323e9b8311b28d81c4d851ecbc: I suggest using http://code.google.com/p/jsrelaxngvalidator/ with the schemas Validator.nu uses and porting the rest over using GWT"
