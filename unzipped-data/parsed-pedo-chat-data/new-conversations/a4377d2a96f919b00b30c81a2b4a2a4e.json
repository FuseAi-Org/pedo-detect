        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (02:59): So have I. The creepiest one was this guy who wanted to trade pictures of female friends on Facebook.

        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:00): Well I think the hope",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:00): is that somewhere out there, there are more resources",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:01): Rather than simply more space",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:01): Beause if it were an isue of space alone, it wouldn&apos;t be an issue.",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:01): Maybe in outer space, there&apos;s a giant ball of gasoline",

        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:02): And of course there&apos;s the hope that we&apos;ll find aliens we can talk to",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:02): and trade stuff with",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:02): but that is much less likely.",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:02): Have you ever read a short story called &quot;They&apos;re Made of Meat?&quot;",

        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:03): It&apos;s like maybe 3 pages",

        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:04): They somehow manage to make every cool part of the story into crap",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:05): They get rid of the last line which was a minor twist, they changed who the main characters were which also changed their perspective and the actors delivered everything in a dead pan that made really funny dialogue seem repetitive and impotent",
        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:05): So only watch that if you want to see how you can get every thing wrong",

        "d4aec491ee51bd74f9969e7ba1732a2c (03:06): The second worst adpation of text to film in my opinion",
