Our cameras are on the beach and suspected predators are online. Thanks for joining us. I'm Stone Phillips.  \nSpeaker 2    00:01:02    And I'm Anne Curry. For our latest investigation. We're in Florida where families with children crowd the beaches and theme parks and men who prey on children crowd the internet.  \nSpeaker 1    00:01:11    Over the course of our four day investigation, 21 men showed up at our house on the beach and fun in the sun is not what was on their minds. A warning, some of what you were about to see and hear is explicit. Here's Chris Hansen.  \nSpeaker 3    00:01:29    It's December in Flagler Beach, Florida population 5,000. It's time for the annual holiday parade. The entire police force of Flagler Beach, a town some 20 miles north of Daytona is working parade duty.",

But later that evening, most of those same officers are working one of the biggest investigations they've ever tackled. The police are hiding in a garage behind our latest undercover house waiting to arrest the man who's about to walk inside.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:11    Come inside. It's cold out here.  \nSpeaker 3    00:02:13    34-year-old Mohamed Abdullah works in real estate. He's married and has an 8-year-old daughter.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:21    Hi, how are you? How you doing? How's your drive? Good. Good morning. Yeah, you can leave it open. It's fine.  \nSpeaker 3    00:02:30    Long before he got to the house, Abdullah used the screen names Blondie 9, 19 72 and Mitos 1972 to chat with someone who told him she's a 13-year-old girl,  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:42    So  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:42    I'm gonna go  \nSpeaker 3    00:02:42    Out. But he was really talking to a decoy for the online watchdog group. Perverted Justice, a group we hired because of its experience, pretending to be teens online who are curious about sex. In his chat, Abdullah wants to know the girl's bra size, whether she slept with her old boyfriend, if she masturbates, and if she's ever performed oral sex. Then he says he wants to perform oral sex on her.  \nSpeaker 4    00:03:07    It will be nice, I think you will love it, but you will need to open your legs all the way.  \nSpeaker 3    00:03:13    Then he suggests the girl perform oral sex on him and Abdullah sends along these naked pictures. Note the distinctive necklace the man is wearing and like most of our potential predators, Abdullah makes a date online to come to visit the team.

He chatted with a decoy who told him she was 13 perhaps to make the girl feel more comfortable. The 31-year-old tells the girl, he's also a teenager, just 19. He asks if she's a virgin and what sexual things she's done. He says he would like to perform oral sex on her and asks her intimate questions like how large her breasts are. He sends her a pornographic video and says,  \nSpeaker 12    00:13:02    Can I do that to you? Yeah. If you wanted,  \nSpeaker 3    00:13:05    Just like our earlier suspect, Roach sends along video of himself masturbating, but at the house he remains wary.  \nSpeaker 12    00:13:13    Is someone in the house? No. How someone's gonna see me  \nSpeaker 3    00:13:18    And the standoff continued  \nSpeaker 12    00:13:20    Come is I'm afraid Come in my neighbor out here, open the door up for me. Come on, come here. It's freezing out there. Come here for a second. Please. Come in here.  \nSpeaker 3    00:13:32    Roach decides it's time to move out and the Flagler Beach police move in. Get on  \nSpeaker 12    00:13:37    The I said get on the I didn't do anything. Come on dude. I didn't do anything. I did not do anything. Yet  \nSpeaker 3    00:13:46    He may think he didn't do anything wrong, but in Florida he didn't need to go in the house to commit a crime. It's illegal to use a computer to attempt to solicit a child for sex. We find out later that according to perverted Justice Roach had a sexual conversation with another decoy during our Flagler Beach investigation. And in April, 2006, he chatted with three other decoys during our investigation in Fort Myers, Florida, 270 miles away on Florida's Gulf Coast.  \nSpeaker 12    00:14:17    Okay, I want to have a seat in this chair right here",

Huh? What are you gonna grab?  \nSpeaker 3    00:37:20    We think Collins spots the officers and gets back up on the walkway and starts heading towards his car. That's when our Dateline crew and I approach him. Hey, how are you? Good. How you doing? Good. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. What you up to today? Nothing. Nothing? What are you here for? She's  \nSpeaker 27    00:37:38    Coming to meet her. I talked to her online. And who is she? Um,  \nSpeaker 3    00:37:43    Ally. Ally. And how old is Ally?  \nSpeaker 27    00:37:48    She said she was 14.  \nSpeaker 3    00:37:49    14. And how old are you?  \nSpeaker 27    00:37:50    Um, 33.  \nSpeaker 3    00:37:52    33. And what's a 33-year-old man coming to meet a 14-year-old girl for  \nSpeaker 27    00:37:57    Just to say hi. That's all.  \nSpeaker 3    00:37:58    Just to say hi. That's it. Collins is 34, but I have other things I want to talk to him about. That's you, right? Yes,",

Tell me what womanly things you've done in your short years as an adult.  \nSpeaker 27    00:38:17    I had no intentions, no  \nSpeaker 3    00:38:18    Nothing, no intentions, no nothing. So you drove 60 miles to see a 14-year-old girl  \nSpeaker 27    00:38:23    Just to say hi.  \nSpeaker 3    00:38:24    I wasn't just to say hi. I wasn't  \nSpeaker 27    00:38:25    Planning on doing anything. Absolutely not. I even said it many times. It's just to say hi, I wasn't expecting  \nSpeaker 3    00:38:32    Anything. You may have said that, but here you say, so next after I undress you and kiss you all over, would you like me to lick your <inaudible> and make you quiver? Is that just coming over to say hi?  \nSpeaker 27    00:38:42    That was nothing When I said I was coming over with anything such Absolutely not.  \nSpeaker 3    00:38:50    How can you say that? Well, here's one. Got any friends who you want to double team with me or you think you can handle me?  \nSpeaker 27    00:38:59    That was all a joke.  \nSpeaker 3    00:39:00    Do you think that's appropriate to joke that way with a 14-year-old girl?  \nSpeaker 27    00:39:03    No, but I was on an adult chat site and just in there messing around with someone to tattoo.  \nSpeaker 3    00:39:09    Yeah. And why did you pick someone who said they were 14 years old?  \nSpeaker 27    00:39:13    I I didn't pick them.  \nSpeaker 3    00:39:14    You didn't pick them? So she picked you  \nSpeaker 27    00:39:17    My attention. Not anything other than say hi.  \nSpeaker 3    00:39:20    Say hi. Never  \nSpeaker 27    00:39:21    Met anybody online.  \nSpeaker 3    00:39:22    You've never met anybody online. Do you know how often I hear that you ever watch Stateline NBC? No. You ever see our stories? Uh, yes. On computer predators. What'd you think of those stories?",

We're doing a story on adults who try to meet minors online for sex. If there's anything else you'd like to tell me, I'd like to hear it. If not,  \nSpeaker 27    00:39:53    This is silly.  \nSpeaker 3    00:39:55    What's silly?  \nSpeaker 27    00:39:56    All of this is silly. I'm not gonna keep doing it.

Wow.  \nSpeaker 29    00:40:43    What do you think your wife's gonna say?  \nSpeaker 30    00:40:46    I dunno. What would you say?  \nSpeaker 29    00:40:50    I'd be pretty upset.

Both are coming to visit a girl who said she's 13 years old. But wait until you hear what this man said he wanted to do with her, Kevin. And you'll meet a police officer who drove hours to get here with a gun in his pocket and an arsenal in his car.  \nSpeaker 32    00:42:45    Everything he had, all the weapons were chambered ready to go.
