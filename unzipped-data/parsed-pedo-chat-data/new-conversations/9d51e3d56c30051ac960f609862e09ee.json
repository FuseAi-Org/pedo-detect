        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (23:19): Then I don't have to",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:27): I'm confused as to why the PeerConnection constants aren't all sequential.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:27): Is it meant to allow someone to compose them all into a bitfield?",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:35): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: maybe the numbers map to protocol numbers, in a (somewhat strange) attempt to avoid having to translate?",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:35): (don't recall anything about the underlying protocol)",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:37): http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/images/media-stream-1.png random image in spec is ... somewhat startling (and not terribly enlightening)",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:38): Agree.  Also, somewhat fuzzy, indicating poor scaling.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:38): Which is odd, since the check marks are well-scaled.",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:38): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb: it smells like this spec was made by someone who's only recently read the filesystem API spec, which is in much the same style (both the spec style, and the use of constant ints)",
        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (23:39): 1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb, usually it shows AC-member-only forms as if you were the AC rep, with a note saying &quot;you can't do this&quot;",

        "8b3687499080633e1898fa1dd209ef81 (23:40): Interesting",

        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:45): at least where it really matters (eg. method algorithms), it hasn't gone that way",
        "06cb330920ae58e1614c9145d983b3d6 (23:48): (i'm meaning to compare to the &quot;file api: directories and system&quot; spec, not File API; i suppose i should refer to the former as &quot;file-system&quot; or something)",
