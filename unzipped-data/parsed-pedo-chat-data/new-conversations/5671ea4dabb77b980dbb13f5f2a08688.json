        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:22): Quick question, does Firefox build faster on Linux than it does on Windows?",
        "59e570bef8ead953686ff65207d2dfbc (13:23): that is debatable",
        "54d718f6cca21e66ee5a5e3bfd001912 (13:24): I'd say yes",
        "54d718f6cca21e66ee5a5e3bfd001912 (13:24): particularly once you throw in ccache",
        "59e570bef8ead953686ff65207d2dfbc (13:25): I'd say yes too, but on my machine the difference isn't much",
        "54d718f6cca21e66ee5a5e3bfd001912 (13:26): b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: also, if you were thinking of tinderbox builds then definitely yes, since they don't use pymake on windows which handicaps things further",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:27): True.",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:28): I want to move over to Linux development just so I can use distcc. I have 5 family computers that can serve as compile boxes for me.",
        "ba0b2fd2c1a2dd5df236a31c35d4f814 (13:29): Psychonauts is as good as I remember",
        "59e570bef8ead953686ff65207d2dfbc (13:31): maybe I should investigate distcc",
        "59e570bef8ead953686ff65207d2dfbc (13:31): see if I can bring down my awful build times",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:33): b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: you could also look at colinux maybe",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:34): b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee: colinux lets you run a (modified) linux kernel under windows, with relatively little overhead",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:34): I  actually tried running debian squeeze under Virtualbox, but it seemed that the disk io performance wasnt that great for the linking.",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:34): though last i checked, it can only handle one core",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:35): distcc does all linking on the master box",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:35): so you could use colinux for the distcc slaves, and real linux on the master",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:36): then you dont have to force your family to linux, they can use whatever they want and still be a distcc slave!",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:36): colinux also differs from a full VM, so some things like io may not suffer as much",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:37): I want to install Linux on my laptop, but I don't feel like going through repartitioning and the like.",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:37): All my servers use it though.",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:38): colinux also helps to avoid repartitioning, since the FS is just held in a regular image file",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:40): Hmm colinux looks good. Ive always seen it, but never looked into it.",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:42): id normaly recomend andlinux (colinux+ubuntu root image+xming), but the root image it comes with is fairly old",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:43): all of the packages in sources.list are gone from the mirrors",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:44): if you already have linux elsewhere, its easyer to just build the root from another system and use colinux directly",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:45): I wish windows had a free native build distribution software. I've only seen Incredibuild which is mad expensive.",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:47): a quick test with dd in colinux shows 16.9 MB/s write speeds",
        "58b21a134b22a29d4c7f0925d5974fce (13:48): over the cobd interface (colinux block device, converts a file on windows into a block device in linux)",
        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (13:57): Out of curiosity, what OSes are you guys deving on?",
        "34d8477ce4dfd8bba0f2577ae97efa7d (13:59): https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&amp;rev=98c45fd7c1a2 - I try to star. the star doesn't stick.",
        "34d8477ce4dfd8bba0f2577ae97efa7d (14:04): is it necessary to click &quot;add comment&quot; after clicking a star?",
        "54d718f6cca21e66ee5a5e3bfd001912 (14:05): 34d8477ce4dfd8bba0f2577ae97efa7d: yeah, press the star next to the suggestion, then either add a comment, or auto-add the comment using the star icon next to add a comment",
        "54d718f6cca21e66ee5a5e3bfd001912 (14:05): next to the &quot;Add a comment link&quot;",

        "b60a738d7a8e8f059f7d64ceb848a5ee (14:06): is getting a kick out of talking with firebot..",

        "34d8477ce4dfd8bba0f2577ae97efa7d (14:18): I don't understand why libxul linking complains that NSSUTIL_GetVersion is hidden, but it can find NSS_GetVersion. I cannot spot any differences in declaration. I'm on Linux. &quot;objdump --all&quot; gives me lines with identical flags for both symbols (one in libnss3.so, the other in libnssutil3.so)",
        "34d8477ce4dfd8bba0f2577ae97efa7d (14:20): never mind. i think I have an idea.",
