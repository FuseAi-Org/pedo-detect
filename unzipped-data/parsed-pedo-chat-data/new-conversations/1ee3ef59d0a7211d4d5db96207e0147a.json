        "e3f4faa9934f37a83d51c0c8821f5f2e (22:12): I've tried the diff command on the commandline and that seems to work okay...",
        "e3f4faa9934f37a83d51c0c8821f5f2e (22:13): Just not sure why the MyDiff function is messed up... perhaps it's something to do with the filenames portion",

        "e3f4faa9934f37a83d51c0c8821f5f2e (22:28): so that's what it's supposed to look like",
        "13207d4a6fdf7376e203fcd2a5ae632a (22:29): I assume you have the windows split vertically too",

        "e3f4faa9934f37a83d51c0c8821f5f2e (22:29): now that I know how it's working",
        "13207d4a6fdf7376e203fcd2a5ae632a (22:30): Alternatively you can open one file and do  :vert diffsplit anotherfile",
