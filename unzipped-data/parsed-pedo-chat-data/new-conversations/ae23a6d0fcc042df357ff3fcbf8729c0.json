        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:13): I'm using the HTML5 boilerplate build script. it says you should use a style.css, which imports the needed CSS files. this is fine is most cases, but I have a custom page that needs an entirely different layout. how may I do this?",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:13): 16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122: what do you mean?",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:14): just include a new css file if you want?",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:14): if you want a single css file output at the end of the build then you need to @import",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:14): otherwise include as you feel like",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:15): in my default.properties I have file.root.stylesheet = style.css. the build.xml looks for this. when it finds it, it gets concatenated with the @imports it holds, minified and renamed to its sha value. however, my style.css imports my _global_ layout. however, I have a page with a completely other design",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:16): and this design should use completely other CSS files, which I want to be concatenated and minified as well",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:17): so problem is, if I include style.css in this custom design, all my global CSS files will be included, because file.root.stylesheet can only equal style.css. if it's called anything else it won't be processed",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:19): 16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122: can you file a ticket at https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/issues/",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:19): 2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e: yes. so this isn't possible?",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:19): no i dont think so.",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:19): we recommend using a single stylesheet",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:20): yeah the buildscript doesnt fare too well if you use different sheets for diff pages",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:20): its not that smart",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:21): 2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e: but that means I would have to include ALL the CSS declarations across ALL my pages (that is, support the CSS for about 200 pages in one page)",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:21): ya",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:21): jikes",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:21): how big is one of those extra files",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:22): I have ~200 different CSS files ranging from 10-200 lines",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:22): 16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122: even if you ahve radically different layout you shouldnt have too much code",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:22): ideally",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:23): the network cost of an extra HTTP request is really high",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:23): 2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e: well, it's not really a solution for me to package all my CSS in one file. sure, you have to minimize the HTTP requests but each page is unique",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:23): but anyway, problem is, I have a page that's completely different. so they would conflict",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:24): then maybe you should run the build script on each page?",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:24): 16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122: you could customize the build script for your reqiurement in project.xml",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:24): because this is not a typical requirement",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:24): for most websites.",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:24): ya",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:25): and its hard",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:25): but",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:25): we're interested in the solution when you figure it out",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:25): :)",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:25): 2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e: so to be clear, most websites package all their CSS across all pages in one file? (of course, you can split it in the imports for maintainability)",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:26): yes 16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:26): its what is recommended choice.",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:26): I just fear that this CSS file will be way too large at some point as your site increases in size. however, that's not a problem?",
        "2cdd7064b290132617248dbfd85f740e (18:26): if you gzip your files it wont be that large.",
        "16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122 (18:30): a solution would be to allow the user to define some default stylesheets and define page-specific stylesheets that can be concatenated and minified as well. then the user wouldn't have to download the default stylesheets all the time but download the page-specific ones. most users don't see all pages anyway",
        "175e7f457c8f4893c459a9e6d57d0f76 (18:54): 4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049, I've seen a lot of sites use a server-side language to compile different css files and return them to the user as one.",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:55): sounds fine",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:55): 16a9b5ff504eb5cb01b1971987a97122: i think if you put a stylesheet ref outside of the comments",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:55): it is kept along",
        "4c681049601b3c374f1d2c0077c99049 (18:55): maybe need to add it to the bypass as well? ?",
        "513dbf85640888dca3d9aa6998647cfc (19:00): hi guys",
        "513dbf85640888dca3d9aa6998647cfc (19:01): is there a way to get an array with all images embedded in a canvas?",
        "1353d9b683d6d7b4281d762ca742bdb9 (19:05): 513dbf85640888dca3d9aa6998647cfc, images aren't embedded into a canvas, they're just painted.  its  raster, it doesn't maintain a list of objects",
        "1353d9b683d6d7b4281d762ca742bdb9 (19:05): you'll have to use svg for that or maintain the list yourself",
        "513dbf85640888dca3d9aa6998647cfc (19:05): hmmm right, okay :)",
        "513dbf85640888dca3d9aa6998647cfc (19:05): 1353d9b683d6d7b4281d762ca742bdb9, thank you",
