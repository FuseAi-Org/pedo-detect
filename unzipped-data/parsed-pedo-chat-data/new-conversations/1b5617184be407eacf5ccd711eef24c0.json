        "5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67 (15:24): What's the reason for that?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:42): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I'm not sure I understand your round-tripping question",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:42): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: did you mean parse as HTML5, serialize as XHTML5 without namaspace prefix or CDATA sections and reparse as HTML5?",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:43): I think there'd be some edge cases related to &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt; content starting with a line feed",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:44): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: as for whether the adoption agency stuff is stable under reparse, I'm not sure",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:49): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK. I was thinking of the use case where somebody might want to take an html source file, parse and serialize to xml because they want to run some xml tool on it (to do some minor xslt transformation on), then serialize that (slightly different) result back to html",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:50): xslt part being just an example",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:50): general case being just to be able to run it through xml tools",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:50): a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: that's possible but the HTML serialization may not parse back as the same DOM",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:51): right, Ok",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:51): depends on what kind of tree comes out of the XML tool",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:51): conceptually, that's what the XLST4HTML5 sample program that comes with the V.nu parser does",
        "a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2 (15:52): yeah, this is coming back to me now from the previous time(s) I asked the same question",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (15:52): it just skips the parts of serializing to XML and parsing the XML back",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:54): Hixie: test 4 is wrong",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (15:55): expect(i.nextNode(), document.getElementById('instructions').firstChild);",

        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (16:04): Hixie: also, other tests seem to create and insert links, so document.links[0] doesn't point to the link to reference.html. i'm not sure if this is a bug in the test or not, yet",
        "73eaf221abca1b8244e34b0b9e76ac46 (16:04): (i.e. when checking against document.links[0] in test 4)",
