        "3fe446bf43186a0a6ab70e26fba86a53 (19:51): I was kind of hoping for getting the tree open today, but is not looking as promising as it was earlier.",
        "3fe446bf43186a0a6ab70e26fba86a53 (19:54): I suppose, we could keep mozilla-central closed and open inbound very metered and manually look at logs because tbpl is not working, but that is a lot to expect people to do over Christmas holidays.",
        "3fe446bf43186a0a6ab70e26fba86a53 (19:56): So, I think keeping things closed until tbpl is reporting correctly is rally the only choice here.",
        "3fe446bf43186a0a6ab70e26fba86a53 (19:59): But the real issue here seems to be that the release engineering people have no real idea how tbpl works and the tbpl people really have no idea how the build system works.  So, I think if we fix those issues we have a good way to go forward.",
