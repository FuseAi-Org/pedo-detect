Good evening and welcome to Dateline. I'm Chris Hansen. I'm back in the resort community of Ocean County, New Jersey. It's a scenic spot on the shore where we've rented a multimillion dollar home and discovered it's a rich place for potential predators. This time, 28 men showed up sometimes two at a time you'd think they'd know. By now, you don't have to tell me. I know who you are. Who am I? We should be Chris Hansen. We are in Ocean County, New Jersey for our 11th internet sex Predator investigation. You're Chris Hansen. I am here. Men will show up after making a date online, apparently, hoping for sex with a young teen and know exactly what they've walked into. This is, uh, the Dateline thing. Seem to realize what they're doing is illegal and you know what happens next.",

I knew, and I see the stuff on tv. And as we told you last week, the number of men convicted in connection with these investigations is growing so far. 118 men have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty by a judge or jury. How do you plead guilty, your Honor. Dateline rented this summer house on the ocean in the off season and hired Perverted Justice, the online Watchdog group as consultants. By what street are you passing PJ's? Volunteers are experts at pretending to be kids online for this investigation. They're opposing as 12, 13, or 14 year olds. The volunteers are in local chat rooms waiting to be hit on by adults interested in sex. Perverted justice says its volunteers. Never contact anyone first. Once a man makes his intentions clear, he's invited over to our undercover house. Two guys come back to the garage asap staked out in the detached garage are officers from the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office. They're working with Perverted Justice, ready to arrest any man who attempts to meet a minor for sex. Del from pj. Hands over chat logs to the arresting officers, providing them with the evidence needed to charge a suspect with a crime. What were your expectations?  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:23    We wanted people to show up.  \nSpeaker 0    00:02:24    Mike Neville, a lieutenant in the computer Sex Crimes Unit for the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office says it was his first time working with a civilian group and he was pleasantly surprised. Perverted  \nSpeaker 1    00:02:36    Justice did a great job in providing those leads to us because their information they provided us in the chats, everything was 100% accurate.",

You, you got on a motorcycle and drove six hours from Pennsylvania to get here to meet a 14-year-old girl. Anyway,  \nSpeaker 18    00:40:04    I was coming just for something to do.  \nSpeaker 0    00:40:07    There was nothing to do with people your own age in Pennsylvania,  \nSpeaker 18    00:40:10    I'm not allowed to go to bars, you know, stuff like that. That's what everyone my age wants to do.  \nSpeaker 0    00:40:15    Right? You're also not allowed to go meet 14-year-old girls for sex, by the way, whether you're on probation or not.  \nSpeaker 18    00:40:21    Correct? That is a true fact.  \nSpeaker 0    00:40:27    Well, Todd, it's something you gotta know as I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC. And as I mentioned before, we're doing a story about adults who try to meet young teens online for sex. He gathers up his belongings unaware as he heads to the door that his troubles have only just begun. This registered sex offender is about to get arrested again. And there's one more potential predator we'd like you to meet. That's 37-year-old Kazuo ASU knocking on our door. Hey. Hey. How I'm glad you made it. Yeah, I know. He's been chatting online for more than a week with a decoy, posing as a 14-year-old using the screen name Caz 45 41. He asks the girl about having sex on the beach, then says he's not into that. He wants a nice comfortable bed. He also has a birthday wish. Sex with a decoy.  \nSpeaker 13    00:41:32    Do you want some brownies? Um, not for now.  \nSpeaker 3    00:41:36    He smelled like he was smoking in the car beforehand and hasn't showered in a couple of days.  \nSpeaker 13    00:41:41    You didn't bring me any chocolate. No. You know why? Why? Because, um, I didn't want her to find it. What do you mean? Yeah, the wrapping and everything. I would've thrown it away. No.  \nSpeaker 0    00:41:57    So explain again why no",

No.  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:05    So what's your plan here today?  \nSpeaker 13    00:42:06    Well, I was gonna just see her.  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:08    He admits her is a 14-year-old girl named Sandy, who we met online. He says he was 37 and works for a major department store in New York City. So you just decided today after work that you're gonna jump in the car to meet a 14-year-old girl named Sandy.  \nSpeaker 13    00:42:27    Yeah. That's it. <laugh>.  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:28    That's it. That's it. You thought it was appropriate at the age of 37 to come meet a 14-year-old. Why? Explain that to me.  \nSpeaker 13    00:42:36    Um, I didn't think it was appropriate.  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:42    Your chat was pretty darn explicit with her.  \nSpeaker 13    00:42:45    Yeah.  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:46    And you acknowledge in the chat that the age thing could be a problem. Sandy, I am more than twice your age.  \nSpeaker 13    00:42:53    Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. I know what I did. What am I gonna do now  \nSpeaker 0    00:42:59    Then? Caz 45 41 says he's feeling ill. You talk about her having a hard time enjoying sex because she's a virgin and that it might hurt.  \nSpeaker 13    00:43:11    Can please go to that? You can, you can go if you'd like to, but I, I  \nSpeaker 0    00:43:15    Think I need to tell you something first. And that's, I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC. And we're doing a story on adults to try to meet kids online for sex. Now if there's anything else you wanna say, we'd like to hear it. If not, you can obviously walk out the door. You came in, we call for an EMT who comes in and examines him. It turns out to be nothing serious.  \nSpeaker 13    00:43:48    Yeah, he's clammy. He's definitely, come on, let's scoot up to your feet. Let's see your head. Alright,",
