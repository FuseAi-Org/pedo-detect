        "7d84dff7cea4398eaf9cd4e8bf221f19 (02:08): however, as lpc pionted out, globbing works with :n but not with :e",

I've followed the instructions in :h termcap-cursor-color, and it works if I open vim in a plain xterm, but not under screen. I've tried the line if &amp;term =~ &quot;xterm&quot; || &amp;term =~ &quot;screen&quot; instead of the original, but that doesn't work either.",
