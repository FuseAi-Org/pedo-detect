        "fca2fab4a7479513eb5b2990a79704d3 (06:22): maybe something with the TERM setting",

        "fca2fab4a7479513eb5b2990a79704d3 (06:24): but for some reasons it fails in .tex files, if the first line does not include something like \\section or similar",

        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:28): so, has anybody noticed that if you hit a number soon enough after leaving insert mode, vim returns to insert mode?",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:28): happens in versions from 6.3 to 7, at least",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:29): seems to be a bug to me, but it's hard to believe there'd be such a bug in vim",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:29): especially one that stayed through all those versions",

        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:30): I'd search for bug reports, but I'm not sure how to search for this",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:30): Aha!, I have the xterm_clipboard option out, that's why I can't use the + register",

        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:31): pretty fast",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:31): hehe, let me try",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:32): try hitting a number immediately after exiting insert mode",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:32): that should trigger it",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:32): or alternatively wait until just after the -- INSERT -- fades and try it",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:32): ohhh yeah, it does",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:32): yeah ..weird, huh?",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:32): but only in the terminal version",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:32): I never noticed it until a few days ago, but I keep running into it now",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:32): not in gvim?",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:32): I cant do it in gvim",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:32): it's happening to me in gvim on windows",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:33): nope",
        "828997d3329f6368569d69d0d2baa3e6 (06:33): it doesn't happen for me even in terminal",
        "828997d3329f6368569d69d0d2baa3e6 (06:33): probably it's interpretting the esc+number as an escape sequence or something",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:33): yeah that must be it",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:34): so now, how to fix it",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:35): wait no.. duh!! I was wrong.. I'm sorry to tell you that it doesn't happen here.. I was hitting the s key which triggers insert mode..",
        "828997d3329f6368569d69d0d2baa3e6 (06:35): maybe play with 'esckeys'",
        "44f437ced647ec3f40fa0841041871cd (06:36): stupid, I know.. sorry",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:36): ah, I see",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:36): hmm, I'll look in the docs for esckeys, thanks",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:37): ooh, that looks like it",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:38): w00t, that worked, thanks",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:39): actually I changed timeoutlen, so theoretically those escape sequences still work, assuming the computer is faster than my hands",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:40): or rather, ttimeoutlen is maybe the one",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:41): actually never mind, I'm faster 1 millisecond according to vim",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:43): argh ..huh, even with esckeys off it still does it, weird.  I'll have to mess around with this for a while",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:44): maybe having compatibility mode off overrides the setting",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:46): weird, setting 'noek' turns off my arrow keys like it should, but doesn't fix the problem",
        "d766753409e3b649d78d44cb45aa2062 (06:49): man, doesn't even work in compatibility mode",
        "828997d3329f6368569d69d0d2baa3e6 (07:00): jeezus, vim's source is crazy messy"
