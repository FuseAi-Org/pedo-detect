        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:38): would it improve the web?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:38): it would improve consistency",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:38): I agree it looks less nice",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:38): but it makes matters more predictable I think",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:38): due to stupid decisions earlier on",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:41): i dunno that it really helps much in this case",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:41): points out http://whereswalden.com/2010/01/29/humor/ for the benefit of anyone here not reading p.m.o (and who, incidentally, have by far the highest probability of understanding it of anyone who might read it :-) )",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:41): hah",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (12:41): what would srcDoc improve consistency with?",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (12:42): aren't all HTML attributes all lowercase?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:42): he's talking about the IDL attribute",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:43): Shouldn't it be src-doc in HTML to be srcDoc in IDL?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:44): not necessarily",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:44): e.g. contentEditable",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:44): I don't think I care, but: document.createElement(&quot;a&quot;).hreflang",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:44): may be the odd man out",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:44): yeah, I just noticed that one",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:44): i think looking for consistency in HTML and its APIs is a fool's errand",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (12:44): i'd just go with what makes the most sense",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:44): I guess hreflang sets a precedence for both",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:45): I see hreflang as similar because the first word of the compound is abbreviated; are there others like that which are capitalized?",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:45): .tBodies",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:45): or not-abbreviated but lowercase-mashed",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:46): whoa, that's some funky caps",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:46): never would have guessed .tBodies existed",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:47): others are e.g. tabIndex, contextMenu, accessKey, maxLength, readOnly, useMap, isMap",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:47): bgColor counters hreflang's precedent",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:47): I guess it's a bit off topic since there's no a content attribute for it",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:47): or maybe it's only lower-mash if all parts are abbrevs?",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:47): and a bunch of presentational and obsoleted attributes, noShade, noHref, bgColor, ...",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (12:48): continues on the fool's errand",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:49): vAlign counters that somewhat",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (12:49): or colSpan",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:03): ignore the deprecated ones when looking for a pattern to hang this lampshade on",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:03): we can argue those won't be used by authors so aren't relevant",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (13:05): enctype, I'm guessing, isn't deprecated, maybe argues for &quot;short&quot; compounds not being capsed",
        "8c8837db54a2907cacd8633547977e33 (13:06): but I'm getting tired of racking brains for obscure element names :-)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:08): I'm fine with srcdoc, but I also successfully argued for itemId, itemType, itemValue, itemRef, itemProp, and itemScope",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:09): so I guess in the future someone can point at this line on krijnhoetmer.nl and blame me if they got confused",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (13:09): There I'd argue item is a common prefix, so the camelcase is useful",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (13:10): However, srcdoc is abbreviated enough to be equally readable with or without",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (13:10): (in my opinion)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (13:10): hopefully the confused people of the future will concur",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:13): i agree with a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9",
