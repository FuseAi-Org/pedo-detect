        "f17df95f77e0187feb7fa14ec3ef246b (15:07): [OT - programming]: could be smart to use a '\\0' to erase a char from a buffer gap?",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:07): claudio`: \\0 ends a string",

        "f17df95f77e0187feb7fa14ec3ef246b (15:08): then? :)",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:08): claudio`: Yes, that would work",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:08): It wouldn't remove the char, it would cut off the string",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:08): Which is the same as removing the char iff that char is the last of the string",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:09): claudio`: iirc, it is the recommended way to remove passwords etc given on the commandline",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:09): sjamaan: Well, it the entire string is filled with \\0, he would probably get what he wants :)",
        "f17df95f77e0187feb7fa14ec3ef246b (15:09): uhm.. i think that this way is better then reallocate the whole buffer (56 bytes).",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:09): mrEriksson: He didn't specify clearly enough what he really wants",

        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:14): mrEriksson: Copy protection?",
        "11dcbf8105451bb7a15317b15a0e60f1 (15:14): what do you mean 'licensing protection'",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:14): Some people do that with special hardware",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:14): sjamaan: Well, more like something that requires you to enter a valid license to be able to use the software",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:15): Oh",
        "11dcbf8105451bb7a15317b15a0e60f1 (15:15): mrEriksson: an md5 sum embedded?",

        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:15): Sounds lame",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:16): You can md5sum the user's name",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:16): yukonbob: I was thinking something like that too, but don't really know how to make that use unique keys for each machine etc",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:16): Then let them fill in that sum as their key",
        "11dcbf8105451bb7a15317b15a0e60f1 (15:16): what's the language, and platform?",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:16): sjamaan: What? To limit the usage ?",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:16): yeah",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:17): yukonbob: C++, using Qt, the application will be used under Linux, Windows and MacOS",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:17): If you really want to limit the number of installations, special-purpose hardware should be the way to go",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:17): Or do what M$ did with VirtualPC",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:17): They scan the network to see if there is anyone using Virtual PC with the same licensing key",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:18): If there is, the app is disabled until that other user quits his Virtual PC",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:18): sjamaan: Well, it is a special program to do calculations for wireless equipment,, And since this is a rather complex process which if used wrong could make the equipment look crappy or inadequet,, So usage should be limited to licensed engineers",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:18): Ask them some engineering questions",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:19): If they answer correctly, they're qualified to use it",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:19): So they are not trying to make money of it, just to avoid getting bad press and reputation because people don't understand what they are doing and blames errors on hardware instead",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:19): sjamaan: Haha,, well, that could perhaps work :-)",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:20): Like those old adventure games where they ask riddles only the manual has the answers to :)",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:20): umhum :)",
        "6926705165f9c109b3dce48ea3c7b45c (15:21): Or, enter the second word on the fifth line on page 93 of the huge manual provided with this game :)",

        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:25): I think that's the trick",
        "b2ffda25cfed2e1adeff06e4fb2f7901 (15:25): Because an MD5sum has a fixed length",
        "11dcbf8105451bb7a15317b15a0e60f1 (15:25): that's easier...",
        "11dcbf8105451bb7a15317b15a0e60f1 (15:25): store it in a &quot;magic&quot; string, and when you hit the magic, skip.",
