        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:17): though it does still split things into chunks",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:17): but I'll just need to upload the new version which has a new list of split ids",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (14:17): which is hopefully trivial",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (14:20): the serialiser has issues iirc",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (14:21): looks ok to me, though we need to fix some Anolis bugs too in due course",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (14:22): but I thought the service from b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea was not stable?",
