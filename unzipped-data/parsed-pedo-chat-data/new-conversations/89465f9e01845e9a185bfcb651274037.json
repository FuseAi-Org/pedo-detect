On Windows however, the dots above the uppercase letters (?\u00d1?\u00f1?\u00fa) are cut off for no apparent reason on certain font sizes. Lower or higher font sizes still lead to partially cut off dots. Does anyone have any idea on how to fix that problem? Here's my fontface definition: http://pastie.org/private/nzcvkymbzjhkot72bh",
