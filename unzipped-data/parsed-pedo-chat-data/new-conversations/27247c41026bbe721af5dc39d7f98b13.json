        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:39): yeah I should do that",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:40): I've been tempted to make that comment a few times, but I'm not sure how to put it after I've already done a more constructive review",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:41): overall I just get the feeling that the marginal benefit of the Link header is not worth all the effort, especially since there are alternatives",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:44): personally i rather like the link header, it's the registry i'm not sure about",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:49): the concept is sort of nice, but UI for most link values has failed pretty badly",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:49): also for &lt;link&gt;",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:50): and &lt;link&gt; had its decade and didn't really deliver apart from rel=alternate combined with some feed sniffing",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:50): oh i wouldn't have many rel values, indeed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:50): but rel=stylesheet, for instance",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:51): is useful in a Link header",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:51): it's a nice gimmick :)",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:51): and confuses the heck out of people too",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:52): got quite a bit of email when I initially announced http://id.annevankesteren.nl/",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:53): oh?",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:53): i guess the other neat bit is styling text/plain resources thanks to their page load processing model",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:53): i was just thinking that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:53): i've actually done that",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:53): even applied XBL bindings to text/plain",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:54): i bet Mark didn't mention that in his security considerations section...",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:54): yeah, but text/plain is quite close to proprietary formats",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:54): how do you mean?",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:55): there's no semantics for headings etc. they're quite visually oriented files usually",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (22:55): Proprietary ASCII art?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:55): there's no semantics, sure",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:55): it's plain text",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:55): that doesn't mean it proprietary :-)",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (22:55): There's no semantics in PNG either.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (22:56): Or most formats anyone uses, actually.  HTML is an odd duck.",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:58): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, fair enough; I guess my point was that I don't think it's a good exchange format",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (22:58): it's not especially great",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:00): It's fine for some things.  Like, say, source code.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:00): . . . well, you could serve that with the MIME type of the source code, really.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:00): It's widely used for e-mail.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:00): I dunno, it works.  No need to be complicated if you don't need it.",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (23:06): hmm",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (23:06): somehow, it seems to me that everyone except HTML users can get by without much formalized semantics",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:16): And HTML users do too, since HTML authors almost never actually write proper semantic HTML.",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (23:19): yet a lot of people seem to strongly desire semantic HTML",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (23:19): 4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b, why does http://id.annevankesteren.nl/ have two almost identical Link headers?",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:41): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762, that's incorrect, modern web designers have been authoring semantic HTML for years.  It's been state of the art since early 2000s.  See archives of simplebits.com for example. And look for &quot;semantic XHTML&quot; as well as &quot;semantic HTML&quot;.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:42): f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905, I didn't say modern web designers haven't been authoring semantic HTML for years.  But in practice, the large majority of HTML that gets served is not what I'd call semantic HTML.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:42): Most HTML authors neither know nor care much about semantic HTML.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:42): &quot;almost never&quot; is an incorrect characterization",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:43): An overstatement, perhaps.  Substitute &quot;most HTML authors don't actually write proper semantic HTML&quot; if you like.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:43): HTML is a very easy technology to get started with, thus it is expected that there's far more beginners. eventually the ones that do it more adopt semantic HTML.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:44): and all the top books in the field cover semantic HTML",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:44): Then why is http://www.google.com/ heavily presentational?",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:44): e.g. Jeffrey Zeldman's Designing with Web Standards etc.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:44): google.com isn't heavily anything",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:45): People who do stuff like write books or hang out in #whatwg know all about semantic HTML, and might care too.  That doesn't mean the average HTML author does.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:45): I would say this is pretty presentational: &lt;body bgcolor=#ffffff text=#000000 link=#0000cc vlink=#551a8b alink=#ff0000 onload=&quot;document.f.q.focus();if(document.images)new Image().src='/images/nav_logo6.png'&quot; topmargin=3 marginheight=3&gt;",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:45): That uses presentational attributes I never even knew existed.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:46): and one example does not an average make ;)",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:46): google tends to be more backend focused",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:46): You said &quot;eventually the ones that do it more adopt semantic HTML&quot;, without qualification.  Since the authors of the Google home page probably work with HTML a fair bit, I think it's a legitimate counterexample.",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:47): What I see in HTML is a tremendous amount of evangelism by standards cognoscenti, which is largely ignored by authors.  With, of course, notable exceptions, no dispute there.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:47): Aryeh - google.com home page is an edgecase. to see how the authors at Google code (and parse) check out their work on Rich Snippets",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:47): it's all about semantic HTML",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:47): and microformats",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:48): so yes, even at Google, the state of the art is semantic HTML + microformats",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:48): and moving more and more in that direction",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:48): Google Maps supports hCards",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:48): etc. etc.",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:48): Well, I'd put microformats in a different category from things like using &lt;h1&gt; instead of &lt;font size=5&gt;&lt;b&gt;.",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (23:48): kk.  Was wondering if UI was permanently orphaned.",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:49): focusing on wrapping up 1.0.1 versions of microformats specs that take into account numerous resolved issues and errata.",

        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:49): to exit CR there needs to be two interoperable implementations of every feature",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (23:50): CSS WG is pretty hard core about  real world interop requirements",

        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:50): I guess new features aren't really likely in CR.",
