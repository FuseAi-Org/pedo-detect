        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:13): lol. XML is so unpopular I might as well remove it",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:14): HTML is the most popular output format (obviously)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:15): then from more popular to less popular: gnu, text, json, xml, xhtml",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:17): but XML seems worth keeping because it's used on the generic side",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:31): interestingly, the HTML5 facet is used more than the generic facet from browsers, but the generic facet is more popular than the HTML5 facet as a Web service",
