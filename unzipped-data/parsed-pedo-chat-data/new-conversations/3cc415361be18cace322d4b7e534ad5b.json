        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (05:50): Philip`: no, that's the same as the status quo, effectively",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:08): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, re: &quot;btw f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 if you can suggest some page-only heuristics (i.e. not involving the network) for detecting bogus longdesc=&quot;&quot;s that would have caught them in the URLs i mentioned, it would be useful&quot;",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:09): the only other heurisitic I thought of what checking the URL to see if it ended in .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. since linking a longdesc to an image is pointless. But that would have only caught one example that I found",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:10): re [D] links and longdesc, http://joeclark.org/book/sashay/serialization/Chapter06.html#d-links",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:10): that can be summarised as: &quot;[D]&quot; links look awful, difficult to associate a link directly with the image, longdesc doesn't cause catastrophic bugs in browsers, and &quot;[D]&quot; links are as bad as &quot;click here&quot;",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:12): I think the first issue can be solved by using different link text or hiding it with CSS,",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:12): the next could possibly be solved using &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;a rel=longdesc/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;,",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (06:13): and the third is countered by the argument that existing use of longdesc is more harmful",
