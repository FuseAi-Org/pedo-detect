        "250b62f8c821ff3712fadca5aebd19fd (20:15): kde4 on windows, or kde4 on cygwin? (two different things)",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:18): asfak: they might prove to be interesting testcases, but ROS is very much developed from a Windows perspective",
        "3e5c430d871870351b224a9023721ddb (20:18): asfak: elaborate on 'implications' ?",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:19): that is, you shouldn't expect to see foreign widget sets and libs become part of ROS",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:20): to the extent that code from Unix-oriented projects is used, it's code that implements interfaces and standards that would be expected in a native Windows environment (e.g. samba for SMB, Mesa for OpenGL)",
        "1f46358417f408b3aef79f6702c708fd (20:30): Mr Ged, i am non-techie, Implications means, if in near future kde4 application and desktop is ported to windows, and gets compatible with reactos (if possible) we would get great many software like K3b and others on reactos.",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:31): Zhila: Windows, judging by the build instructions",
        "3e5c430d871870351b224a9023721ddb (20:32): asfak: when it runs on Windows, it will run on ReactOS",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:32): asfak: If someone makes the effort to port it to Windows, I don't see why not...",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:33): cdrdao and cdrtools have Windows ports, although I'm not sure whether they're native",
        "1f46358417f408b3aef79f6702c708fd (20:34): yes, it has started, look here, <a href=\"http://www.kdelibs.com/wiki/index.php/Status\">http://www.kdelibs.com/wiki/index.php/Status</a>",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:34): there is actually already a Windows cdrdao/cdrtools frontend called BurnAtOnce, although that's not quite as glossy as K3b and the license is a bit questionable",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:36): asfak: I meant whether someone will port K3b to Windows after KDE is ported; for something like a CD burning app there are likely much deeper considerations than just GUI toolkit and desktop environment",
        "7e79a68e4f97d75ae6176c9b1e8aa733 (20:36): even if the bulk of the backend tools are already ported",
        "1f46358417f408b3aef79f6702c708fd (20:39): yeah, i agree, esp gtk based..",
