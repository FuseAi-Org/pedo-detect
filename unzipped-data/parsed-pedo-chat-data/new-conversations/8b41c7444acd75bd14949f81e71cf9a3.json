        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:13): guess no one is here, but I'll leave my question and maybe someone can get back to me",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:13): is it possible to run tomcat as a webserver, not just as a servlet runner?",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:14): why would you?",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:14): I know it can server html pages, but as far as php, cgi scripts or javascript?",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:14): when httpd does a top job of that..",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:14): its a long story",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:14): but the short of it is",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:14): I wrote my own proxy servlet that needs to run on port 80",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:14): but I still have web content that needs to be served",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:15): because of firewall restrictions, and I cannot use the rewrite engine or mod_proxy because they cause a buffer issue with my live feed proxy",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:15): so you wrote a servlet that acts as a proxy?",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:15): yes",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:15): why didnt you just put your ssh port on port 443, then reverse ssh tunnel to a real proxy on that same box  ( i do that to get around my uni restrictions)",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:16): cause the problem with all the 'real' http proxies is they don't assume continous responses",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:16): and buffer",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:16): I need the proxy to pass data as soon as it comes back, not when it 'all' gets there",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:17): so I wrote my own :)",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:17): which does not buffer",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:17): am I making sense?",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:18): yer",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:18): i just see that if you used an ssh tunnel this wouldnt even be an issue heh",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:18): I'm not really even sure how that would work to be honest",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:18): windows user?",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:18): can you explain it to me or point me to a place where I can read up on it",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:18): mostly, I just started work at a new place which is all unix",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:19): well sshd runs on port 22",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:19): k",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:19): if you run a second sshd on prt 443 (https port) the firewall at your school wont bloack it",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:19): so you can ssh to that server without restriction",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:19): once you've done that, you can setup a tunnel and access the net unrestricted",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:19): assuming you have a proxy server of some sort on that port 443 sshd box",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:19): yeah except I have the opposite problem :)",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:20): the access from the clients to our servers is restricted to port 80",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:20): its no proble mfor us to open additional ports, but the clients cannot get out on anything  but 80",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:20): so we have to accept on 80 and hand it off internally",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:20): oh fun",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:20): yeah..",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:20): well the answer to your question is it can be done",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:21): but itll be painful",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:21): and you'll set fire to your workplace",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:21): I'm used to painfull... I'm a programmer",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:21): when you could just setup httpd + mod_proxy",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:21): mod_proxy bufferes responses :(",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:21): I tried that first",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:21): arh",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:21): no idea then dude sorry",
        "b0df24743f31103dc18fbd1eac2b7324 (20:21): Hi.  I am setting up apache 2.052 with tomcat 5.5.17 using virtual hosts.",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:22): and it even ahs a freaking parameter ProxyIOBufferSize",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:22): which does nothing :P",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:22): lyken but as far as having tomcat serve php and/or cgi pages&gt;",

        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (20:23): im yet to see anyone successful..",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:23): alright, I'll do some googling then",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:23): damn it",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:23): I was thinking I can proxy connections through tomcat to another apache server",
        "b0df24743f31103dc18fbd1eac2b7324 (20:23): I will provide whatever info that could be useful in resolving the problem.",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:24): on some other port",
        "61f3b82fa048f6205175a129dc149716 (20:24): but then its really a mess...",
