        "4f27d37bf5ad4c99ad9d2a0f1d13db7a (21:45): and tell us the results :)",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:47): hey, if you're a regular here and have some time here and there, would you please mentor me?",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:48): how's that tom?",
        "4f27d37bf5ad4c99ad9d2a0f1d13db7a (21:48): well sounds like a good question to me :)",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:48): cool",
        "4f27d37bf5ad4c99ad9d2a0f1d13db7a (21:48): what exactly do you need mentoring for?",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:48): well, my first &lt;super-dooper&gt; website of course!",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:49): first. as in, never before but 'must' be done",
        "4f27d37bf5ad4c99ad9d2a0f1d13db7a (21:49): you have never made a website before?",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:51): no never",
        "4f27d37bf5ad4c99ad9d2a0f1d13db7a (21:51): ok",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:52): I like these pages up top there, they make it look simple enough",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:53): my main thing i want to contribute to this discussion, don't completely disregard html tags and whatnot just because it is an &quot;html4&quot; tag",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:53): most of the html4 stuff is still around and valid, html5 mostly adds to the list",
        "25e25811b87578fe2fe8126c0de0fe98 (21:53): the only thing you should stay away from is frames",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:53): and simplifies things",
        "25e25811b87578fe2fe8126c0de0fe98 (21:53): and tables for layout :O",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:54): ok",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:55): any doctype beyond &lt;!doctype html&gt; is too much typing and wasted characters :P",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:58): 0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 would you mentor me? (do you have other favourite pages on the subject you could share, and some insight into making &lt;super-dooper&gt; webpages, and a little time here and there to chat?)",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:58): (pages other that the ones up top there  - I mean)",

        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:59): read, research, try things out, tinker, and if you have questions, come on in here and ask",
        "ef8ccc1b692468d287d03e25c95605e7 (21:59): I wouldn't be surprised if, with a great set of bookmarks, I could make good without much supervision anyway",
        "25e25811b87578fe2fe8126c0de0fe98 (21:59): the best way to learn websites is to read on the internet and examine some nice-looking websites",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (21:59): whether it's me chiming in or someone else, hopefully someone can help or point you to a good resource",

        "25e25811b87578fe2fe8126c0de0fe98 (22:01): although if you've never made a website before it may be better to start with how exactly everything fits together in the beginning",
        "0fe8692be7a494c6561f745b9f3b0d17 (22:01): which is why i said to not disregard html4 stuff",
