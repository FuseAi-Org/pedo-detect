        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:04): Greetings, what's better imap server courier or cyrus?",
        "c7973aff9b7bdb0a0ad08d5b3d1ee712 (19:07): FLAME WAR!",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:08): ok, I don't want flamewar, so I consider it doesn't really matter which one I choose :-)",
        "5a88748c4bb3824bcfff53e433213900 (19:08): courier is nice :)",
        "c7973aff9b7bdb0a0ad08d5b3d1ee712 (19:09): CYRUS IS NICER!",
        "5a88748c4bb3824bcfff53e433213900 (19:09): I choose the ugly, but working one ;)",
        "5a88748c4bb3824bcfff53e433213900 (19:10): I am using courier with mysql/virtual-users - works without a problem, but I think you can say the same about cyrus",
        "c7973aff9b7bdb0a0ad08d5b3d1ee712 (19:10): personally, I use dovecot",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:11): ok, what about configuration effort - for each of those (same?)",
        "c7973aff9b7bdb0a0ad08d5b3d1ee712 (19:12): dunno about cyrus/courier, but dovecot's pretty straightforward. works with mbox and maildir in the default spool and the config file is pretty plain.",
        "5a88748c4bb3824bcfff53e433213900 (19:13): courier uses one central config-file for auth-purposes, which can be used then for pop3, too",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:13): I see, dovecot homepage mentions the requirement of having all users in /etc/passwd - is there a way to avoid this?",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:14): but please use CONFIGURE_ARGS+=--with-ioloop=kqueue with dovecot on *BSD.  I plan to commit that to the Makefile tonight or tomorrow",
        "c7973aff9b7bdb0a0ad08d5b3d1ee712 (19:14): juhe: dunno",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:14): juhe: the homepage says you don't have to configure anything *if* your users are in /etc/passwd",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:14): but you can use mysql/pgsql/ldap/textfiles/... anything you want",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:14): ok, I misunderstood..",
        "c7973aff9b7bdb0a0ad08d5b3d1ee712 (19:14): juhe: it's usually safer to have a UID for each accounts anyway. that way their imap processes are separated from each others.",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:15): nod",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:15): that could be said of any virtual user setup",
        "c7973aff9b7bdb0a0ad08d5b3d1ee712 (19:15): and /etc/passwd is pretty fast. it's backed by an indexed database.",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:15): but you can configure dovecot to have one process per login, and have those processes chrooted in each user's homedir, etc",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:16): ok, when is your password database gonna be a bottle neck for an imap server?",
        "c7973aff9b7bdb0a0ad08d5b3d1ee712 (19:17): ghen: maybe after a few thousands entries",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:17): well, I don't want each user having email account and vice-versa.",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:17): furthermore most SQL and LDAP databases use indexes as well",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:17): juhe you could configure it so that only UNIX users which are member of the group &quot;imap&quot; (for example) have imap access",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:17): ok",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:17): or as I do it:",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:18): use /etc/password as userdb, but use a separate password database and only give those users a password :)",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:18): :-) nice.",
        "75fedd09d0527e5fdfe478d57def6c19 (19:20): it's a beautiful day",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:21): yep, my server burnt out, it released magic smoke (electrical devices do not work without it) so I'm configurin now...",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:27): please cvs up your pkgsrc/mail/dovecot dir before installing dovecot",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:27): (I just bumped pkgrevision to 2)",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:29): ok :-)",
        "ceff3145f870d115cea3291d0abede73 (19:29): :D",
        "3db2edd84fe2671f9b0b3d945e7a94f0 (19:29): anyways, I decided to give it a try",
        "7fc042bf92d0ad6545c99c0d47a39696 (19:32): juhe: good luck",
