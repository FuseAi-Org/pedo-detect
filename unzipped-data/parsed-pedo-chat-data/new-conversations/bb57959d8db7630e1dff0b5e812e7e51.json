        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:50): yes, it is",
        "1d9124d8c1cfe97d0d1ad07a359c0d57 (14:50): in my team the most important golden rule is that level of nesting should not exceed 3 or max 4 levels",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:50): Moridin8: nice to meet you, my name's Rik",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:50): well, really, you say if(condition)...the next thing is obviously what to do next. why do you have THEN",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:50): it's like...duh",
        "1d9124d8c1cfe97d0d1ad07a359c0d57 (14:50): regardless or method size, OO, patterns, code organization and so on ... deeply nested code is the worst in my eyes",
        "1d9124d8c1cfe97d0d1ad07a359c0d57 (14:50): sometimes its easy to remove, sometimes isnt",
        "1d9124d8c1cfe97d0d1ad07a359c0d57 (14:51): definately is possible to avoid in the first place",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:51): I don't think I've ever found a need to write code more than 3 or 4 levels",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:51): Hi Rik... I've said hello before.  =)  been in and out over the last 5 months... (Friends with Smellyhippy)",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:51): I'm Matt",
        "d14ad43afe6d1f4cbdd4aef95c2e9f45 (14:51): genericity is also a good concept for reuse. Very few languages have generics at the start sadly. It's always a bolt-on extra a few years after the first issue of the language comes out",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:51): peterR, yeah, what's with that",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:51): Moridin8: I was introducing myself as a sometimes VB programmer who understands OO, but hi anyway :)",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:51): Java and C# *just* got generics in the past few years",
        "d14ad43afe6d1f4cbdd4aef95c2e9f45 (14:51): one notable exception is eiffel - though hardly anyone uses that",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:51): *doh*",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:52): sometime VB programmer is not the same as a career VB programmer",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:52): peterR``: C++?",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:52): C++ has them and it lets you typecast anything to anything",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:52): Emon... Generics was always intended for C#...",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:52): peterR``: ok, we all know how that went... slowly",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:52): It's a bolt on to VB though.",
        "d14ad43afe6d1f4cbdd4aef95c2e9f45 (14:52): C++ has had generics for a long time, but they weren't in there at the start",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:52): ah",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:52): I had a convo with a M$ bod at a show once.",

        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:53): M$ are holding onto VB purely because people still insist on using it.  Good for the cash... thats about it really.",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:53): you guys should have seen this VB code I saw on nopaste a week or two ago. I just randomly clicked on one of the &quot;recent pastes&quot;. this guy coded in, hard, conversions of 0-255 in hex using strings or something",
        "98f37d3231e4d7eab19e5103a4f88c98 (14:53): eeeeeeeeeeew",
        "98f37d3231e4d7eab19e5103a4f88c98 (14:53): my boss just gave me a hp notebook",
        "98f37d3231e4d7eab19e5103a4f88c98 (14:53): brand new",
        "98f37d3231e4d7eab19e5103a4f88c98 (14:53): I just tuned wtf",
        "98f37d3231e4d7eab19e5103a4f88c98 (14:53): how can he give me a HP???",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:53): Oh, you know what it was? He needed the strings of 0x00 to 0xFF, so he hardcoded all of them in. all of them. 255 lines.",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:53): 256, actually, and to top it off, each line was a good 150 characters long",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:54): I almost shat my pants from laughter when I saw it",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:54): Moridin8: VB.NET's fine... it's just like C#, with slightly different syntax. There's a couple of annoyances, like static data looks ugly, but there's a couple of things that make life easier too",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:54): Emon... VB promotes bloat.",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:54): Moridin8, no, that was just an idiot VB programmer. He could have put it in a damn loop",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:54): Well, yeah, it does promote bloat, but this was not because of VB, this was because the guy was clueless",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:55): apparently he didn't realize you could convert ints to strings..",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:55): Integer.toHexString(int) is it?",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:55): Rikkus:  I'm not here to start a c# vs VB war.  So I'm stopping to convo.  I hate VB.  Always have.  I'm from an Assembler C++ background.  so less typing to achieve elegent code the better... IMHO",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:55): assembler c++?",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:55): you mean assembly and c++? :P",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:56): Assembler AND C++ ... typo",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:56): Moridin8: in that case you'll love vb.net, because vs.net fills in half the syntax for you - so you do less typing than with C# :)",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:56): Rikkus:  not that I have found...",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:56): an assembler is a program, not the language :P",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:56): well, I'll measure it someday",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:56): rikkus, less typing, maybe, but you end up with more text",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:57): Emon: yes",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:57): and god forbid if you ever want to view a vb source file outside of VS...you don't have those lines to separate your routines",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:57): I put blank lines between them anyway",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:58): yeah",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:58): I just don't see the appeal for VB, really",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:58): seriously, why bother anymore",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:58): I turn those sodding lines off myself.  just extra clutter...",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:58): Emon: because it's the same as C# with more words in the syntax",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:58): years ago I found it more confusing than C++, I just used it because I didn't know how to make GUIs otherwise",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:59): MFC sucks",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (14:59): hehe",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (14:59): I didn't touch GUI's unless it had a Web front end.",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (14:59): Emon: and those words can be a good or a bad thing... they're bad because they're visual clutter, but they're good because you can see what the end of a block is.",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:00): rikkus, I suppose, but if you're using an IDE anyway, it'll highlight the matching braces",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (15:00): Emon: that's true",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (15:00): though you may have to hover over them",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:00): I mean, I SORT of see why it's nice, but at the same time it's just confusing",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:00): and overwhelming",
        "e930486dc1ff22e535dfd95d2b4ea972 (15:00): and if you need to do that, your method's too long :)",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:01): not necessarily",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:01): but I see what you're saying",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:02): J# is kind of cool",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:03): but...what's the point? It's supposed to be an intermediate language between Java and C# or something, but any decent programmer doesn't need a &quot;transitional language&quot;...I certainly didn't",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:03): and I don't consider myself that great",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (15:04): it's so you can port the stuff more easily",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (15:04): it's part of the .NET migration portion",

        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (15:04): or, that was my understanding of it",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:04): that's true",
        "69e2e9b6faa43ce63a2ecee941ecc641 (15:06): although, I've never written in it myself",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:07): I poked around in it, then said, &quot;whatever&quot; and went to c#",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:07): after I learned that it had no generics",
        "0194bfef36fc3ad600f7beb9ee198871 (15:07): I thought, &quot;fuck that&quot;",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (15:18): ;) before anyone says go look on google (I have - i'm after oppinions), does anyone rate any good C# JSON parsers?",
        "f52974b56ef747f73d918e80a6de21c6 (15:18): I don't have time to write one",
