        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:33): No",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:34): So WebSQL will definitely something we won't see in our webpages in the future?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:35): Inded",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:35): Actually wondering, why not? I mean, it could be quite handy in the light of the more offline apps",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:35): Because there's a lack of interest from implementors, apart from those who've already implemented it",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:35): And that all of them like it anyway",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:35): That's kinda bad",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:35): IndexedDB is the future",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:36): ok let me look it up",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:36): Actually, for a presentation of HTML5, in the light of a CMS i have completely renewed (non HTML5 techniques, just a year ago) I was trying to convince people in a presentation how HTML5 offline web technologies will come to the rescue in a CMS like this",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:36): WebSQL was a part of the story but I have to remove it now",
        "2c801963ac4e96f503bacd185b18a79c (13:39): hm, offline storage is going away?",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:39): localStorage will contain to exist, and IndexedDB will come into existance",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:40): *continue",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:40): ergh, I can't spell",

        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:40): ok",
        "2c801963ac4e96f503bacd185b18a79c (13:41): hm, as long they dont do that for websockets...",
        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:41): WebSockets has wide support, and is implemented by almost everyone. It's far from in the situation Web SQL ever was.",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:41): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: so basically, what I could explain is something like: The CMS could have an option to work offline, as in, indexedDB will store the pages and their rights etc in tables, localStorage will store the page contents, App cache will store pictures Icons",
        "2c801963ac4e96f503bacd185b18a79c (13:42): ok, glad to hear websockets arent scheduled for removal :)",
        "2c801963ac4e96f503bacd185b18a79c (13:42): will read up on the websql thing",

        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:42): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: is that a correct approach simply said?",

        "2c801963ac4e96f503bacd185b18a79c (13:44): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: any radical changes expected there?",

        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:47): a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554: I also have made a list of HTML5 (and HTML5 related) APIS .. just main, primary not every exact, but the important ones to present.. is this a list which farely represents the more important APIS?",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:47): canvas, video/audio, drag &amp; drop, app cache, geolocation, workers, localstorage, microdata, indexeddb",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:48): I know there is a lot more, but this is just a small presentation",

        "a11aabeeceeae6b8cb5d12ea06b56554 (13:48): Well, most of them aren't actually in HTML5",
        "be51bd0bf909e7c2ce4328e2f9bb04b4 (13:48): (and some that are not maintained by WHATWG HTML)",
