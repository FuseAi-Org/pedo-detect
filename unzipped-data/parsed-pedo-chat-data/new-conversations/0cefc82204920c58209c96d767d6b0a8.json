        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:49): either the disks are not a single point of failure, or they are two single points of failure",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:49): i would never go without redundant disks",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:49): and i would never got for less than six disks for a production system",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:51): or perhaps system, data, log+index... or other config as well... depending on the workload",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:52): it's almost suprising how fast a dirt cheap dell 2850 with six drives can be",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:53): Zauephuaes: i would go for zfs ... rock solid and fast mirroring",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:54): yes, zfs is faster with compression turned on .. since the cpu often idles while waiting for blocks from disk.. fewer blocks from disk means more cpu time consumed but less ideling... cool cool",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:54): i should say, zfs is _often_ faster ...",

        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:54): since any block saved is a huge improvement",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:55): so, one / slice, one /var and then a massive zfs disk of the rest",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (01:55): ah, and one metadb slice... and possibly two more slices for LU",

        "620832d09e1a18cad9e0f3a1cdf98002 (02:00): can the root drive be ZFS? Or that's a separate issue from the volume manager?",
