        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (02:20): so say, if I assign hme0:1 as the zone1 IP address, when I access it from the outside, it'll lead me directly to zone1 and know nothing about the original box ?",
        "4fe573ff41aefb42de56ddf2771295ea (02:20): yes, but don't use hme0:1, just say hme0",

        "4fe573ff41aefb42de56ddf2771295ea (02:21): correct",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (02:21): but isn't zone1 is like a different machine ?",
        "4fe573ff41aefb42de56ddf2771295ea (02:21): you don't tell it the alias number to create, it does it automatically",

        "2ff36a90ba1881a7c4e8c481a35d00d3 (02:25): at this point I recommend the Solaris docs",

        "2ff36a90ba1881a7c4e8c481a35d00d3 (02:26): no, you're supposed to treat it as a black box, from the global zone",

        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (02:27): FurnaceBoy , so it seems that the only way I can get into /export/zone1  is  via  zlogin",
        "2ff36a90ba1881a7c4e8c481a35d00d3 (02:27): until you have something like sshd running in the zone, yes",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (02:28): if say, /export/zone1  is the path to zone1",
        "2ff36a90ba1881a7c4e8c481a35d00d3 (02:28): you can use loopback mounts to share file trees",

        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (02:29): so being root on global zone, if I do  ls /export, does it list  zone1  ?",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (02:29): just curious",
        "2ff36a90ba1881a7c4e8c481a35d00d3 (02:30): yes, and there are root and dev directories in there. but there's no point in going any further in. :)",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (02:30): if the original path for zone1 was  /export/zone1",

        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (02:32): say you're lazy and just wana copy a small file  to the local zone1 upon the request of a user, why bother copying it to a shared directory, then copy to local zone when you can directly copy it there :)",
        "e282c1b5ca7363d9439f97f76f10056d (02:33): I only do that stuff on install.... I copy shit like sysidconfig and such",
