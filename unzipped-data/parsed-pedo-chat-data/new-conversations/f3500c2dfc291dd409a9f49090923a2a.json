        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:06): I wonder if that X3D activity is a response to canvas3d",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:06): ah yes",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (03:06): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: hehehe",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:07): yippee",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (03:07): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: what is x3d?",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:07): it's like the SVG of 3D",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:07): except, I suspect, worse",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:07): I think it evolved from VRML",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (03:08): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: heheh",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (03:08): worse the svg?",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (03:08): wow",
        "47223c0fa41aa7e167a2d1fd2740cbb8 (03:08): hides",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:14): 042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427: It is indeed evolved from VRML",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:15): You can express it in 'classic' VRML syntax as well as in XML syntax",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:15): excellent",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:15): two syntaxes for a format that's not even really deployedyet",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:16): There's quite a number of independent implementations",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:16): If you're careful, you can even write a scene that works in at least two implementations",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:17): (It's also an ISO standard)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:17): aaah, why are we talking about x3d",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:17): tries to get to a safe place",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:18): I'm not sure X3D is particularly crazy or anything",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:18): but why did it come up!",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:18): actually i know nothing about 3d",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:18): Because I saw http://www.web3d.org/x3d/wiki/index.php/X3D_and_HTML5",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:18): though people seem to keep asking me about stuff to do with it",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:19): (and because somebody emailed me about the X3D-in-canvas3d prototype I wrote ~16 months ago)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:19): jesus, everybody and their dog wants to put their vocabulary in html5",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:19): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e: You've added lots of other things into HTML5 you know nothing about :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:20): i'm confident in saying that i know more about everything in html5 than i do about 3d anything",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:20): but that admittedly doesn't raise the bar very high",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:20): 3D is just like 2D, except in a different direction",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:21): 2D doesn't have things like lights",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:21): and cameras",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:21): Depending on your level of abstraction, 3D doesn't have those either :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:22): Cameras are just transformation matrices, and lights are just vectors you feed into your shaders, and it's easy when you copy-and-paste the scary maths from somewhere",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:22): woosh",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:22): I'm sure it's easier to understand than &lt;keygen&gt; :-)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:23): actually &lt;keygen&gt; was easy to understand, it just wasn't documented",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:24): i wonder how we should allow people to annotate their HTML documents with a datetime representing the last substantial update",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:24): (or if we should not)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:25): Sounds like a job for the microdata hammer",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:25): one existing solution: they could use hAtom to markup the page as an entry with an &quot;updated&quot; datetime.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:27): i don't want to make html5 hardcode any magical class values; last time i did that i got yelled at so much it had to be removed :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:28): would wonder what a &quot;substantial update&quot; is, but decides instead to go to bed",
        "f5af272b5b04154c260eec46f4deb905 (03:28): no need to hardcode any magical class values in html5 - simply don't bother to solve the problem in html5 and let people use the existing solution",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:28): this is actually part of some other problem i'm solving",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:29): (namely adding Atom as one of the formats you can export to in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#converting-html-to-other-formats )",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:35): I was quite clearly to say &quot;not really deployed&quot; instead of &quot;not implemented&quot;",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:35): I was quite *careful*",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (03:35): I wish I knew another language so I could pretend English wasn't my first language",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:35): i wonder if the x3d-in-html5 effort is related to the people who asked me if collada could be put in html5 &lt;canvas&gt; recently",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:36): if &lt;article pubdate=&quot;&quot;&gt; gives the datetime that the article was published, what would be a good attribute name for the datetime that the article was last modified?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:37): (or alternatively, what would be good attribute names for published datetime and updated datetime respectively; it doesn't have to be pubdate)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:44): eh screw it, i'll just have only pubdate",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:44): oh hey, updates can already be annoted using &lt;ins&gt;/&lt;del&gt;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:45): so i can just get the date from that"
