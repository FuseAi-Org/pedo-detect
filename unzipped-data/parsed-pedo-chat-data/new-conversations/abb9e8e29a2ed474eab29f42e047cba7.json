        "1ab15f3644d1a5e1c282965e97a4603a (22:16): before 1995 it was called sunos. then it changed name to solaris but the kernel is still called sunos",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:16): ah",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:17): makes sense why the sunos version is in line with the solaris version number",

        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:28): what is the overlap slice for?",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:28): you don't have to have it unless you plan on using it.  But it comes standard if you pick one of the regular patch clusters",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:29): er package clusters rather",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:29): it is for raw volume access",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:29): right, I want to setup a mirror after I do the install",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:29): it is a slice containing the entire disk",

        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:29): so I'm doing a minimal install and want to make sure I have what I need",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:29): just make sure you have some extra spaces in there for the metadb's when you partition it",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:29): understood",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:30): Hasues: so by default autofs'ing the drive won't give me that extra space",

        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:30): well this is my first time installing so I'm not sure what the typical slice setup is",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:30): I'd leave two small slices..one in the middle of the drives some where, and then one on the end.",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:30): that depends what you are using it for",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:31): for this server, the only purpose is to test mirroring",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:31): its a test server",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:31): oh. then it hardly matters",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:31): I have a 800mb /, 512mb swap and 2.6gig /export/home",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:31): with some blank slices inbetween",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:31): but its still a good practise to keep one slice unformatted so you can create your metadb files",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:32): does this config sound good?",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:32): I think your / is too small. but then I am a noob",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:32): actually, it would be better if you kept a couple of slices unformatted for that purpose, one larger than the other if you have a smaller number of disks (which you only have two, so I'd say that qualifies) as you want to have at least 3 metadatabases at all times, and so you can stick two of them the larger slice",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:33): esp if you want to dump your patches in /var/spool/pkg",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:33): I agree with visceral.  You don't need all the space to /export/home for what you are doing, unless you forsee alot of stuff being exported out on the /export/home slice",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:33): if its two. I'd suppose you want to have 2-3 metadb files per disk",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:34): I'm banking on three",

        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:34): ok, lets say for the sake of the production server I'll be doing after this test server",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:34): er practices.",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:34): Yes, I'm going for best practices :)",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:34): 3 is good. one is really bad",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:34): this production server is a v210 with 73gig harddrives",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:35): if you have two disks you want three on one disk in the event one of the disks fails.",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:35): good idea",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:35): then yeah, you will have six total.",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:35): are you going to have more than one production node?",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:36): once you have the disk partitioned the way you like, you can prtvtoc -h /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s2 |fmthard -s - /dev/rdsk/c1t1d0s2",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:36): depending of course on what controllers and such your disks are using.",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:37): and assuming both disks are of the same size",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:37): good lord, I would hope so.",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:37): that depends on your distributor. or your sources",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:38): if this is a 2nd hand machine, anything goes",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:38): hehe",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:39): yes, same size disks",
        "7c1792c03c5ce7d1af1119856c83a48a (22:39): sounds like visceral works in some sloppy kitchens",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:39): personally, I'd want to set up a test machine, put in what I want. back it up for redeployment in jumpstart - then I'd dump the backup back to the same machine - and this time I'll know how much space I am going to use",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:39): yes I do",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:39): very sloppy. and I am still peeved that snmp_trapsend is not snmp v2 compliant",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:40): I was reading something about 50% + 1",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:40): is that why you put 3 on each disk for 2 disks?",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:40): 2 or 3 makes sense. if its just one per disk. and one metadb file cant be contacted - you are screwed",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:41): everything I've read recommends 3",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:41): I guess it would be helpful to understand what these metadbs actually do :)",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:41): its in chapter 9",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:42): okay. I cant remember chapter 9 of what. but its on sunsolve",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:42): lol",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:43): I'll dig around",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:43): do you have vmware?",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:43): yup",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:43): why dont you practise it on vmware a few times before you deploy on your machine",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:43): that way, you can judge whats the best allocation",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:44): yeah I suppose I could install solaris 10 x86",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:44): and if this is going to be a production node, you might have to cater for backup requirements too",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:44): theres solaris 9 x86 too",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:44): and its available on sun.com",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:44): sweet, I'll do that",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:45): for now I'm just looking for best practices from admins who've done this a few times.  our unix admin was canned so I get to use some of my BSD experience and do his duties till there's a replacement",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:45): but you must follow the instructions strictly on vmware.com, or you wont be able to install. this is my personal experience",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:45): do you have a jumpstart server?",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:45): I've already done a solarix 10 x86 install a few times in vmware",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:45): Just out of curiosity, is it convenient to reveal why your admin got canned?",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:45): I think we do",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:46): what sort of backup strategy are you guys using? not NBU I hope",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:46): it seems everyone is interested in such details...are we all gossip whores? :-P",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:46): NBU?",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:46): net backup",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:46): we apparently have a bacula server",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:47): with connected to a loader of 10 DLT4 tapes",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:47): you'll find out during restoration that these agents are useless without an OS running on the machine",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:47): sure but isn't it expensive to buy a tape drive for every machine?",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:47): now I only trust ufsdump 0uf /dev/rmt/0cn",
        "3769bb5100299565ea56ecb5f5249b77 (22:48): so if I have 73gigs of data and I want to partition all user data to a /data slice, what would be best practice for the root slice",
        "b35e20eb10d5ee38c4037597b899fc20 (22:48): I dump my backups to a SF280R, and then write them to an L8 tape connected to the backup server",
        "30967e36448a9cc4a7b13b48a35ba90a (22:48): How do I view a list of all the patches applied to Solaris X86 ?",
