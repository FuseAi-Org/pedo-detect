        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:02): http://damowmow.com/playground/microdata/004/ is my proposal for what we'll test monday",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:02): it takes into account the stuff we've learnt so far",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:06): the item attribute has gone, replaced by itemscope and itemtype?",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:17): At first I assumed itemprop=&quot;fn org&quot; labelled the string as both fn and org, just like class=&quot;foo bar&quot; works.",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:18): But I see the space is part of the name too, is this wise?",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:18): In all other cases a hyphen is used instead",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:19): attempts to use git",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:19): User-friendliness point 1: you can run &quot;git add -n&quot; for the same as &quot;git add --dry-run&quot;, but you have to run &quot;git push --dry-run&quot; and can't run &quot;git push -n&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:21): Steve^: it actually does do what you thought in the real syntax",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:21): Steve^: i just didn't want to try to explain that in the study, and it wasn't the point being tested",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:21): ah, ok",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:22): and yes, see http://damowmow.com/playground/microdata/NOTES for the changes and reasoning",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:22): I'm the guy that notices these things and gets annoyed that the teacher won't tell me the truth :P",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:23): yeah, i know the feeling!",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:23): 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e, who are the test subjects?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:24): the intro doc has to be as brief as possible to not take too much of the hour for them to read, while hitting all the points they'll need for the exercises, so i was focusing on conveying tutorial-like info, not spec-like info",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:24): you mean their names? :-)",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:25): are they people off the street? college students? web developers?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:25): web devs",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:25): and software engineers",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:25): from various walks of life",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:26): then I feel good about my employability",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:26): we",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:26): er",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:26): we've had an interesting range of people",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:26): some were highly competent, and got this concept pretty quickly",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:27): oh",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:27): others thought they did but were stumbling around having problems with things that weren't even being studied",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:27): like basic html syntax",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:27): you mention a few things that were a problem for everyone",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:28): yeah, containership in particular",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:28): i've tried to make the intro doc introduce that concept more forcefully",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:28): to see if it was just a poor intro, or if the concept itself is hard",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:28): similarly i've made the intro say explicitly  that you can't just make up names",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:29): the intro reads very very well",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:30): if it tests well i might just end up using it almost verbatim as the intro section",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:30): itemref seems upside-down to me, if you took a section out of context, you may lose the itemref link and the name/value pair loses meaning or becomes part of another item",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:31): itemfor at least tells you it doesn't belong there, even if you don't know the whole story",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:31): seems the problems exist in both directions",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:33): Require the syntax to indicate the link in both directions, then it's harder to unknowingly break",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:33): I think itemref breaks more than itemfor",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:34): as it could add data to an item that shouldn't be there",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:34): I like the idea of articles being completely extractable, independent of their surroundings",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:35): the problem with itemfor=&quot;&quot; is that it's a performance nightmare -- given an item, you have no choice but to walk the entire DOM to find if there are any more properties",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:38): If you're extracting all the items from a document, that's not a problem, because you have to walk the DOM anyway and you can keep track of itemfors while you're doing it",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:38): so it only seems a problem when you're trying to extract microdata from a specific element on the page",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:39): doesn't know how the use cases typically would be extracting data",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:41): wonders if querySelector('*[itemfor]') would be unreasonably slow anyway",
        "3cd30a070a8cd420f1a52db2a8b12754 (13:42): there are use cases?! :)",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:45): the DOM API would be a case where you're trying to extract microdata from a specific element on the page",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:45): and it happens to be a case where performance is critical",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:46): ok bed time",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (13:46): nn",
