        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:27): wonders if it'd be interesting to see what strings &lt;acronym&gt; and &lt;abbr&gt; are currently used for, to see if they're just interchangable in practice, or if it's best to stay far away from the whole topic",
        "8782ac0c77935b842ee42d72f487cef5 (02:30): The main problem with asking people to distinguish between &lt;acronym&gt; and &lt;abbr&gt; is that they don't know what the difference is (that is to say, an acronym is read out as the letters, like RSPCA, whereas an abbreviation is said, like NATO).",
        "8782ac0c77935b842ee42d72f487cef5 (02:30): I myself advocate keeping &lt;acronym&gt; around and saying people SHOULD use &lt;acronym&gt; for acronyms, but MAY use &lt;abbr&gt; if they don't know the difference.",
        "8782ac0c77935b842ee42d72f487cef5 (02:31): This is the friendliest solution for Web developers, but for developers of e.g. screen reading software it's pretty nightmarish.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:32): The main problem is that people who say they do know the difference disagree on what the difference is :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:32): Wikipedia says &quot;The word acronym was coined during the mid-20th century for abbreviations pronounced as words, such as NATO and AIDS.&quot;",
        "8782ac0c77935b842ee42d72f487cef5 (02:32): Unfortunately that's not modern usage. =P",
        "8782ac0c77935b842ee42d72f487cef5 (02:32): I was taught acronyms are read out as letters.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:34): That's what I mean about people disagreeing",
        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (02:35): Is there anyone who disagrees that an acronym is also an abbreviation, regardless of what an acronym is defined to be?",
        "8782ac0c77935b842ee42d72f487cef5 (02:35): I don't disagree there.",
        "8782ac0c77935b842ee42d72f487cef5 (02:36): So I suppose that's the strongest argument you can give for dropping &lt;acronym&gt; altogether.",
        "8782ac0c77935b842ee42d72f487cef5 (02:39): But I think keeping &lt;acronym&gt; around but allowing unconditional use of &lt;abbr&gt; is marginally friendlier to the makers of screen readers etc.",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:42): Screen readers are only helped if &lt;acronym&gt; is used mostly correctly, and if it's better to trust the markup than to guess, and it doesn't seem clear that that's the case",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (02:49): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, that be useful, yes",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (02:49): would be, even",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:50): should probably expand his collection of pages so there's a more useful amount of data",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (02:56): Do any existing screenreaders treat &lt;abbr&gt; differently from &lt;acronym&gt;?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (02:56): Do any treat them differently to &lt;span&gt;?",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (02:57): That's part of what I'm wondering :-)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:16): There's http://philip.html5.org/data/abbr-acronym.txt of quite limited usefulness or quality",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:19): dunno what the two most common ones are from, but they seem highly pointless",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:22): It looks like it wouldn't be good for a screen reader to try pronouncing &lt;acronym&gt;s as single words",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (03:22): not to read out the individual letters",

Do we really need to differ between acronyms and abbreviations? What about initialisms and the other types of words?&quot;",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (03:33): screen readers are going to read it the same way they read text/plain",
