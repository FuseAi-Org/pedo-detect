        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:02): I didn't expect to to be in the middle of nowhere",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:03): guess I should have paid more attention",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:05): I think I can see your building from my window.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:05): You're not completely lost :-)",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:05): I know where the meetings are",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:05): took the bus from the airport and went out at INRIA instead of Les Templiers",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:06): so I had to walk back over the moterway...",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:06): That's not a motorway... And there is a bicycle lane along it on the soutge side.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:06): oh",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:07): And walking on the motorway is forbidden :-)",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:07): The &quot;real&quot; motorway, I mean.",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:07): oh good",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:07): so I haven't quite violated French law yet",

        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:10): In typical French fashion, that parallel lane for cycling is interrrupted for a span of 10m or so next to a rundabout, so bicyclists have to use the roundabout, and *in the wrong direction* :-)",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:10): Food...",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:11): you know, the stuff you put in your mouth and makes you go yummy",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:11): The nearest places are Biot (many restaurants), the Ibis hotel, MacDonalds (near the motorway exit)...",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:13): None of them really close. 2 - 2.5 km...",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:14): yeah, guess I'll have to take a taxi",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:14): Ideal distance for a bicycle :-)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:15): is that an offer? :)",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:17): My bicycle is 7 km away, in Antibes :-)",

        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:18): Nearest restaurant is probably not the Ibis but the &quot;country club&quot; or what is tis name...",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:18): That's walking distance.",

        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:21): Chaals said something about a particular taxi service I ought to use",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:21): 1.4 km, that should be walking distance with your legs :-)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:21): most certainly :)",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (20:22): what's the address?",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:24): SOphia Country Club, Rue des Dolines. It's behind (north) of ERCIM.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:25): Chaals may have been referring to Monsieur Heduy?",

        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:27): house number 3550 on the route des Dolines, to be precise.",
        "bddfdb28870c5800d938fa0993c46d65 (20:27): Don't know what prices they charge. I've played golf there, but never eaten.",
