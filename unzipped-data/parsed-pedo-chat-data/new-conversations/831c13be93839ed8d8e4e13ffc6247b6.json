        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:01): It will work fine",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:01): I've done it before",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:01): a 6200 is no where near saturating a 4x agp slot",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:01): so doesnt even need a 8x slot",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:02): But I guess the voltage conserns are valid",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:02): But I'm glad anyway that this works on my 4x",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:02): but I have had no trouble",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:02): As long the voltage won't kill my board it is fine",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:02): As long as your computer keeps cool",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:03): You may have to get a fan",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:03): *may*",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:03): I think that is not necessary, or?",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:03): depends",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:03): If the case starts heating up after you get the card or not",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:04): Do you have a case fan?",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:04): that 52 only has a passive cooler",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:04): no, no need for a case fan",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:04): only cpu and power",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:04): hmm",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:04): yea but 5200 cards are shit",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:04): compared to 6200",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:05): It is a bit weierd that a 62 can cost more then a 52..",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:06): From the list you gave me",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:06): do you think a very cheap 62 can be less good then a 52?",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:06): 6200 is around the same price",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:06): I dout it",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:06): AGP is starving, that may be the reason",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:06): A low end 6200 should still be better than the best 5200",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:06): i mean a cheap one should still be better",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:07): so you say: send it back and get a 52",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:07): ?\u00a7h 62",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:07): My friend has a 5600 Ultra and a crapy 6200 Turbo cache and the 6200 is still faster",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:07): and the Turbo cache ones are slow 6200s",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:08): what can games could a average 6200 handle with a P4 1500, 400 FSB, 512 SD-RAM, 80GB HDD IDE-ATA",

        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:09): NFSHP2 is a old game",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:09): Oldish",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:10): 4 years old",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:10): I looked up",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:11): Need For speed most wanted",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:11): should work",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:11): hm, I'm going to buy a new board next year. And this will have a PCIe, so its not really necessary",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:11): Need For Speed UnderGround will work on max settings",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:12): Need For speed most wanted will work on ok settings",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:13): I know the 6200 can run alot more games than the 5200",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:13): and the 5200 graphics card would be the thing holding you back from playing games on higher settings not the rest of the system",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:13): ..and as we said: I won't make trouble on a 4x",

        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:15): thank you MoC, I rethink it. It may only be the cost of a send back to the seller.",

        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:15): as I said, I'm not playing much, but how can I on a Nv GeForce 2 MX 400",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:16): ok, I need to go now. Goodbye",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:16): and the cooling thing. I had a cooling problem because of a Graphics card. And all it required was a $5 extractor fan at the back of the case",
        "8f3e9705bdd690c84cdb1f996c341f37 (15:16): And it fixed a major cooling problem",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:17): yeah, I need to care how hot it gets. A extra fan isn't a problem.",
        "67e4e41dceb7ec3707207834a09b8e8c (15:17): Where have you put it?",
