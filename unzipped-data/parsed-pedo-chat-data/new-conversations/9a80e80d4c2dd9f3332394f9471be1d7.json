        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:41): But I think there will be a lot of perfectly reasonable implementations of things that don't quite pass the testsuite",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:42): I don't even know how to reasonably express test suite adequacy in the exit criteria",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:42): I wonder how thorough something like the JCK is compared to the standard we might want for the HTML5 test suite",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:42): Well ideally I would like to have some metric for spec coverage",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:42): Like percentage of assertions in the spec",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:43): I would guess you'd want 100% of testable assertions to have tests",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:43): but then you have to sort out which MUSTs are relevant to the conformance class being tested, and which are in fact testable",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:44): The problem is that making such a metric turns out to be highly non-trivial on its own",

        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:48): well that is another interesting question - which conformance classes are relevant?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:49): Do we need two interoperable implementations of HTML authors?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (12:49): Because I have never seen two authors agree on correct usage :)",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:50): &quot;Web browsers and other interactive user agents&quot; are an almost-superset of the requirements for many of the other conformance classes",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (12:50): conformance checkers are the only other class that is even plausibly testable",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (12:57): It seems hard to test the spec comprehensively when it doesn't distinguish between document conformance requirements that are mechanically verifiable and those that aren't",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (13:01): Is that something that needs interpretation, or just something that can be mechanically deduced from the conformance requirment?",
