        "44a0506a4ba976cd2a1f85aa474aa36d (03:03): xh4: root's password is livecd",
        "44a0506a4ba976cd2a1f85aa474aa36d (03:04): hm. does anybody know, if the ultra 20 M2 also takes non-ECC RAM?",
        "a5e1dcc619bef690cb6ce4ad4a308ea9 (03:05): if you go to www.sun.com, products, desktops",
        "a5e1dcc619bef690cb6ce4ad4a308ea9 (03:05): click on the ultra 20",
        "a5e1dcc619bef690cb6ce4ad4a308ea9 (03:06): under tech specs",
        "a5e1dcc619bef690cb6ce4ad4a308ea9 (03:06): it'll show you teh differences between the ultra 20 and the M2",
        "44a0506a4ba976cd2a1f85aa474aa36d (03:08): thanks. I've visited this site before.",
        "44a0506a4ba976cd2a1f85aa474aa36d (03:10): on the ultra 20 one can use both, on the ultra 20 m2 that doesn't seem to be the case. a german reseller put in the specs the low version of the m2 no mention of ECC memory.",
        "44a0506a4ba976cd2a1f85aa474aa36d (03:10): that's why I wanted to be sure, if it was possible to use non-ECC memory..",
        "44a0506a4ba976cd2a1f85aa474aa36d (03:10): xh4: the root password is livecd",

        "cbfbc849c39a05070cb2191abce7423a (03:11): Too bad the liveCD was so slow I couldn't do anything.",

        "cbfbc849c39a05070cb2191abce7423a (03:11): And ifconfig -a didn't show my PCMCIA wireless card. :'(",
        "aac6faa59982955179bb909138afd162 (03:11): that doesn't mean much, they might not ship the driver, or it might not have been plumbed",
        "cbfbc849c39a05070cb2191abce7423a (03:11): Hm, true.",
        "aac6faa59982955179bb909138afd162 (03:12): iirc the wireless stuff isn't integrated yet, you have to install it separately",
        "cbfbc849c39a05070cb2191abce7423a (03:12): Once I get my new laptop I'll partition it such that I could try Solaris out and, if it doesn't work out, install something else.. but yeah, live CD doesn't really change anything. :p",

        "000d10e6d03eeb8a50a6feed67578cbe (03:32): can i add a raw device to a zone and have it full contrl?",
        "000d10e6d03eeb8a50a6feed67578cbe (03:34): if i have two network cards can I have only one for global and two for a zone?",

        "a5e1dcc619bef690cb6ce4ad4a308ea9 (03:43): I'd guess no on the NICs because you'd be allowing the local zone to mess with the networking in the kernel of the global.... but I don't know"
