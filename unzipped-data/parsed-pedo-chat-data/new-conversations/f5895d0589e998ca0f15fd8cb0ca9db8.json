        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:26): If the physical universe was formed naturally, then there must be a natural explanation to the existance of the universe...",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:27): yes",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:27): do you agree with that statement?",

        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:27): ok, now are the Laws of physics &quot;created&quot; or &quot;discovered&quot;?",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:28): discovered",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:28): right.... the Laws of physics exist...... we can only discover them not create them",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:28): the laws of physics are there and we as mankind discover them",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:29): yes that is the definition of the laws of phisics",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:29): so the 1st Law of Thermodynamics or &quot;Law of conservation of matter and energy&quot; states Matter can neither be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to the other",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:30): correct",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:30): the 2nd Law of thermodynamics or &quot;entropy&quot; states that a system left to itself will expend all usable energy available for work",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:31): .... over time",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:31): yes",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:31): ok",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:32): now keeping these 2 Laws of physics in mind.... we know that the physical universe could not have created itself because of the 1st Law of Thermodynamics, also we know that the universe could not have always existed because of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics...",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:35): so there is no &quot;natural&quot; explanation to the existance of the physical universe",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:36): therefore how we not know there is not a contradictory law that states a &quot;natural&quot; cause of creation",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:36): say again?",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:37): and even so using these laws doesn&apos;t prove the exsistance of a higher power such as god",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:37): in a way it does",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:37): saying we dont know how the universe began isn&apos;t proof of god",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:38): we cannot just make up a fictional idea to fill in gaps in our undersanding of the univers",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:39): if there is no &quot;natual&quot; explanation to the existance of the universe then there must be a &quot;super-natural&quot; (outside of the natural) explanation for the existance of the universe..... now this doesn&apos;t tell us what it is......",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:40): it only tells us that there is not a &quot;natural&quot; explanation to the existance of the universe",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:40): yes but we cannot simply seculate that this is a &quot;god&quot;",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:40): I understand....",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:40): that is just a start...",

        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:41): just because our laws of phisics do not prove that a &quot;natural&quot; cause strated",
        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:41): the universe we cannot say that a supernatural foce did",

        "e2d21f0ff7833dc132cfef1c6565495d (00:43): no there is no proof for or against a &quot;natural&quot; formation of the universe",
        "8bab3c5c62b0a6048129419fef2320a4 (00:43): it only shows that there is no &quot;natural&quot; explanation for it&apos;s existance",
