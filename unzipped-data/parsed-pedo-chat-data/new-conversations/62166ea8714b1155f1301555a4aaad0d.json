        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:47): And no, it's not due to my tendency to inline stuff, either; I found a way to merge a couple of mostly-redundant loops.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:47): (Same loop, different driving query)",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:51): how can i add some code after the window is just drawn on screen",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:51): kinda like a constructor",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (21:52): Aqualuna: by overloading the constructor... Or maybe there's a signal",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (21:52): what version of qt ?",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:52): 4.1",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (21:52): ok",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:52): the problem of ctor is that its execut4ed before the main loop",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (21:52): ok I see",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (21:52): then maybe there's a signal",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:52): ive been trying to find if ther is any event or something but cant find any",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:53): ohh right... i didnt check for the signals",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:56): Aqualuna: Nope, no signals.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:56): But you can MAKE a signal",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:56): Use QTimer::singleShot(0)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (21:56): That'll fire as soon as the event loop starts",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:58): ohhh...  thats a bit tricky isntit",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:58): is that the std way?",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (21:59): what are you trying to achieve at end ?",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (21:59): basically thre is this main window that shoudl open a dialog before",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:00): i need to get some data from thisdialog and then the mainwindow can do its job",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (22:00): ok I see",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (22:00): and creating and showing the dialog in the window constructor doesn't work ?",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:00): first dialog actually asks the project name and a few parameters.. then the main window is used with the data enterd form dialog",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:00): it does",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:01): not sure if its legal (because it happens before entering the loop)",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:01): but it draws dialog before the mainwindow",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:01): and you usually see programs drawing mainwindow and dialog in front of it",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (22:01): ok. What about making the dialog modal ?",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:02): actyually the problem is that in the case the dialog was rejected i was emitting QApplication::quit()",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:02): but it doenst work at all because its not in the main loop i suppose",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:02): im making the dialog modal... im using exec()",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (22:02): oh ok",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:03): i could use exit() but im trying to learn the proper way to deal with this... actually i dont want to exit program.. jsut close the window because i may add a menu that will call this windows",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:03): but that would be done as soon as i get this parts working the way they should",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:04): reject()",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:04): Closes the dialog with a negative result",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:04): just thought that closing the window instead would make this more extensible/scalable",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (22:04): and then catch it in the constructor",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:04): And reject() also emits a signal -- two, in fact; rejected() and finished(QDialog::Rejected)",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:04): accept() is the positive counterpart",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:05): yeah my dialog is using them",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:05): both signals",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:05): ok button connected to accept() and cancel to reject()",
        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (22:05): m",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:05): Right",
        "7780ad7003f15ffc3b31177513eac4f9 (22:05): hi",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (22:05): hi",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:05): So what's the problem?",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (22:05): Aqualuna: I think you're confusing signals and slots",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:06): No, he's got them right",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:06): accept() is the slot, accepted() is the signal",
        "6397c0b52565fba78f90ef9d89638c4d (22:06): oh yeah sorry",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:06): Anyway, Aqualuna...",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:06): Re-reading your problem, try this:",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:06): if(dialog.exec() == QDialog::Rejected) return 1;",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:07): That'll work in main() to kill the app if you cancel, but you can use the return value differently if you open it at another time.",
        "4abb7b4cd23850db7b7aedb075bf8258 (22:08): is there any way to merge 2 labels ( horizontalHeader ) in QTable? qt3",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:08): ahigerd mainwindow needs to call dialog (that basically asks for some project specific parameters)... i tried dialog.exec() on the mainwindow ctor, but that drawed the dialog before the application got into the main loop (QApplication.exec()), so when i emitted a signal for instance if the dialog was rejected, then main window should also be closed.. it just simply didnt work.. becuase we were yet not in the main loop",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:09): Aqualuna: You could run the initial dialog in main() and pass the appropriate values to the mainwindow constructor",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:09): ahi i tried exaclty that.. but that piece of code is on mainwindows const4urctor.. and contrustructor is being executed before the QApplication.exec() so emiting signals at that part has no effect at all",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:09): ahigerd yeah i guess that would work... but that kinda brakes encapsulation",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:10): I disagree.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:10): The main window is supposed to know that information anyway.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:10): main() becomes a controller object.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:10): Which isn't bad OO because otherwise the mainwindow was the controller object.",
        "cdf4ad80dc66a41f951abab3fde0d774 (22:11): One could argue that's actually WORSE OO because you've got core functionality in the GUI.",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:12): hmmm.. yeah but since the dialog is specific to the mainwindow then it could be hided",
        "e180a88c9c6d71c537bc69c02f5ebbd0 (22:13): well i guess ill do it that way...",
        "5022cf57fb9482c659ea223f7e36b50d (22:15): hey blockd have you had a chance to try some of the new .net 3.0-ish WCF and WPF libraries?"
