        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (07:10): yeah, seeked sucks as a name for that",
        "3b14b636129945831fcfcc7294686653 (07:10): I'm not sure sought is much better though",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:21): seeked isn't misspelt. it's just a made up word.",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:21): onsought would confusing the heck out of people",

        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (07:23): it's a made up word",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:25): so? half of our industry uses made up words",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (07:25): no other event names do",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:27): there isn't a single other event of the form ondoneX",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (07:28): that seems like less of an addition than adding made up words",

        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (07:29): and are those truly made up, or using commonly used but not in marriam webster, words?",
        "c096a2c87daf98223b25852e61f6e756 (07:30): One convention is to add onsuccess or oncomplete to the event name, e.g., seekoncomplete, not that seeked bothers me any.",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (07:31): onseekcomplete sounds good too",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (07:32): i have approximately zero interest in worrying about event names, so if y'all realy do have a problem with 'onseeked', then implement something else and tell me what it is",
        "042dd99eb0ff8653814e445ca0093427 (07:32): I don't care all that much either to be honest",
        "c480405f460f7a61964569640a6cd059 (07:32): same here, but it seems easy to fix",
