So why i get only now this debug message? 2) why i get that message on each tty if my syslog-ng is configured to print only on tty-12?",

        "30c68b43da9e37ac7c4589912de529f7 (16:28): Hello people. This might sound like an obvious matter, still STFW yields nothing. I have a setup with three NICs, one goes to Internet and is NAT'ed, and two other go to mutually isolated LANs, with identical setups. The problem is that eth1 is okay, but eth2, while set up with the same rules, cannot get anywhere. ping returns 'sendmsg: Operation not permitted', no matter whether from root or from regular user.",

        "95b9ee549dcd31492cf570b213dd1c53 (16:30): xenoterracide: no, i'm not... the error is the fact that syslog-ng must write debug messages only on tty12",

        "d6527fc06f095e346e2bad4b252ec24f (16:42): because IPTABLES messages are from the kernel",
