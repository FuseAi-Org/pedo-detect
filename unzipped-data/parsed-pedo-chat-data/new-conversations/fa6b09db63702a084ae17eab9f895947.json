I want opening and closing tags for some Esperanto words that are going to be spoken by a speech synthesizer. What ist he best way to map these so I can hit one key and it will insert a start tag independant of the mode I'm in?",
        "471b6cb4cee7c59bc2c0ddce120a1a80 (09:22): or an end tag",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (09:34): anyone know why my Vim might not remember my places in files on a new distro ?  on my two previous distros it has done so",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (09:34): I have a ~/.viminfo and ~/.viminfo.tmp file",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (09:35): and it lists files in it",

        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (09:56): hi all, when key mapping is there a way to map Control + Shift + &lt;key&gt; ?",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:03): bradbev: is this in X or on a real TTY ?",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:03): a real tty",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:03): well, an xterm",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:03): bradbev: often times shortcuts with more than one extender will not register on real TTYs",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:03): bradbev: but in X they will",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:04): sorry - I thought you meant Gvim when you said X",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:04): ah okay.  yeah, so it will definitely work while you're in X, but if you log in on a TTY it most likely won't work",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:04): I use Alt+Up/Down to scroll the window, for example.  but it only works in X",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:04): er, Ctrl",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:05): assuming an Xterm, how would one write the :map?",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:05): anyway, just try entering your choice literally, in insert mode: Ctrl+V (then press the key combo)",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:05): see what appears.  you can also use words, if it's a fairly standard key combo",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:06): ah that is a good idea, thanks",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:06): like &lt;Esc&gt; &lt;Return&gt; &lt;C-E&gt; (Ctrl+E)",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:07): I only know &lt;C-foo&gt; for entering a Ctrl+foo combo, but it most likely has similar syntax for Alt.  perhaps &lt;A-foo&gt; or &lt;M-foo&gt;",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:08): not sure what you'd do for ctrl+shift, though.  nobody else in here seems to be awake at the moment",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:08): ah, ctrl + shift + x == ctrl + x :(",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:08): keymaps and keyboards don't always give unique indentifiers for combinations, unfortunately",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:09): you could try using xmodmap to define a new item for that particular combo",
        "0bd36436820524a652679131b48c0b92 (10:09): you can most likely make it work",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:09): well, I am basing my key may from an existing emacs one, and would like to keep similar",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:10): if it isn't showing up differently in X",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:10): Ctrl+Shift+&lt;any letter&gt; should always be workable",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:10): but, it's by no means essential - just trying to keep the documentation differences down :)",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:10): with special keys like arrows, it's often not possible to recognize them with modifier keys",
        "0bd36436820524a652679131b48c0b92 (10:11): why not use emacs if you want an emacs keymap?",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:11): sqweek: I'm porting a lisp debugger from emacs to vim, and would like to keep the keymaps similar",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:11): I haven't defined many keyboard shortcuts in Vim, around 8 or so .. but I feel lost in Vim without them, heh",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:12): but as I said - it isn't essential",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:12): if you are trying to remap ctrl-shift-foo, give up now",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:12): ain't gonna happen",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:13): even in the gui",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:13): bradbev: if this is intended for other users, keep in mind that using the raw method of entering the key (Ctrl+V, press the combo) will often change when you go to a new X terminal program, to a TTY or logging in remotely.  standard ones like Ctrl+&lt;letter&gt; generally do not change, but half the Alt+&lt;anything&gt; ones will",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:13): when I switched from rxvt to aterm, I had to change several of my Vim shortcuts entered raw",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:14): thanks tpope, I'll just have to choose another mapping",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:14): thanks for the tips Samus_Aran",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:14): standard operating procedure is to start your mappings with leader",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:14): see :help mapleader and :help maplocalleader",
        "ea5407ca34590b5b35a3bc9a0760bf76 (10:15): I never understood the leader thing, won't everybody's scripts stomp on each other?",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:16): tpope: why wouldn't Ctrl+Shift+foo work ?  I use those all the time in GUI",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:16): or do you mean just in Vim it won't be unique ?",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:17): it's the same as ctrl+foo",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:17): so why bother?",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:17): you still clobber another mapping and you waste effort holding shift",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:17): why is it the same in Vim ?",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:18): because even gui vim has a lot of console in its guts",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:18): for example in ICEWM I use Ctrl+Shift+Z,X,C,V,B to do the XMMS keys",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:19): of course. but that's not vim!",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:20): yeah, I was just wondering if you meant it was specific to Vim &lt;tpope&gt; it's the same as ctrl+foo",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:20): of course it could be made to work if fixed at the source, but my guess is bram is none too eager to encourge emacs-like bindings",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:20): I'm tired, just spent the day in the sun =p",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:21): it's specific to vim, most (read: all) consoles, and probably a handful of other things",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:24): didn't notice that it was like that on consoles",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:24): all the letters have the shift dropped",
        "0bd36436820524a652679131b48c0b92 (10:24): you can modify your keymap to change that i believe",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:24): there's no meaningful character for shift-control-foo to represent",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:24): not really, sqweek",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:25): at least, not under X11",
        "0bd36436820524a652679131b48c0b92 (10:25): i meant on a VC",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:25): an escape sequence",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:26): oh delightful, vim copes with those so well",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:26): in my current X terminal F9 = ^[[20~, Shift+F9 = ^[[20;2~, Ctrl+F9 = ^[[20;5~",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:26): Vim handles that form of entry perfect",
        "0bd36436820524a652679131b48c0b92 (10:26): for X11, xterm lets you redifine what strings keys emit to some extent",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:26): to some extent",
        "0bd36436820524a652679131b48c0b92 (10:27): not sure if it's flexible enough to let you modify ctrl-shift",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:27): oh yes, you could probably do it with xterm",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:27): but not in the gui",

        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:29): that's pretty lame",

        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:29): hm, in aterm Ctrl+Shift+2 gave me ^@, but in this terminal it gives me a ^B",
        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:29): odd",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:30): ^@ is more &quot;correct&quot;",
        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:30): but usually you just hit ctrl+2",

        "02a30ecc89fdd7c4aacc67d12dcb1f75 (10:31): so it distinguishes them with Ctrl+Shift",

        "0792377b948579515cfdf726e83cbc23 (10:31): distinguishes, but then there's ambiguity with ctrl+b",
