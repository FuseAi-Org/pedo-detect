        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (12:39): I must admit to skimming the most outrageous quote trains :)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (12:43): I wonder if I'd only contribute to the damage done by the denial of productivity effect of &lt;q&gt; if I pointed out some of its history in order to make a point that the semantic need is questionable...",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:55): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9, please do",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:58): a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9, although I really hate that convention, the solution is to put the punctuation within the &lt;q&gt; element if that's what you need.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (12:58): IMHO, punctuation should only be within the quote marks if it is part of the quote itself, otherwise it should go after.",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:08): The correct method of quoting is obvious in the computerised world: you copy-and-paste what someone else wrote, put quotation marks around it, and then put all your extra words and punctuation outside the quotes",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:09): The old world didn't have copy-and-paste, so they could be excused for doing silly things like adding punctuation inside quotes instead :-)",

        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (13:11): one of the many problems with &lt;q&gt; is that languages high up in the pecking order (en-US and fr-FR) are illogical in the sense that quotation marks do not strictly delimit the quoted string",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:16): if the punctuation should be within the quote marks, then the author should put it within the &lt;q&gt; element. e.g. &lt;q&gt;Some quote.&lt;/q&gt; --&gt; &quot;Some quote.&quot; Otherwise, the author should put it outside. e.g. &lt;q&gt;Some quote&lt;/q&gt;. --&gt; &quot;Some quote&quot;.",

        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (13:17): notes that IE8b2 (at least on an en-GB system) seems to use single quotes for &lt;q&gt; by default, and double quotes once you add lang=en",

        "a924fb58d2c25874322f4e5126f608b9 (13:19): The trailing punctuation is not necessarily part of the quote",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:19): It's not me mangling the quotes, it's the illogical languages that incorrectly stick punctuation within quotation marks where it doesn't belong.",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (13:20): that's why I said &quot;IMHO, punctuation should only be within the quote marks if it is part of the quote itself, otherwise it should go after.&quot;",
