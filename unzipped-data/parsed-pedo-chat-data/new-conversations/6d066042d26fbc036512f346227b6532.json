        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:07): wow, Rob seemed to completely sidestep the issue instead of answering the question http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008May/0263.html",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (17:25): there has to be some middle ground here somewhere such that the a11y people and the critical-content-altless people can stop talking past each other",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:27): Perhaps all the middle ground has been turned into no man's land",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:32): the middle ground seems to be giving up on the distinction between alt not known and purely decorative and using alt='' for both cases",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:34): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: i think that could be reasonable, given that there is a non-trivial amount of content images on the web that have alt='', and so users would miss out if UA ignored them",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:35): (i don't have data but i've seen content images with alt='' more than content images with good alt, i think)",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:35): cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0: of course, the next question is: if no alt and alt='' mean the same thing, why bother with alt='' except for backwards compat and in order to have more error cases",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:36): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: indeed, i'd be fine with making no alt and alt='' equivalent and have alt optional :)",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:38): thinks data would help, to determine roughly what &quot;non-trivial amount&quot; and &quot;more&quot; mean",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:38): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c: indeed",
        "cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0 (17:39): i might be completely off and hence my conclusions wrong",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (17:46): hmm, webcams that take a snapshot every x minutes and upload it to the web are like blind photographers but remove humans from the equation entirely",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (17:46): I think that might turn into my new example of choice",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:47): b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f: whoever sets up the Webcam knows what general direction it is pointed at",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:47): What if the webcam is mounted on a robot that is controlled remotely by visitors to the web site?",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (17:48): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: not on a laptop",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (17:49): I should start collecting these cases somewhere",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:50): the MathML stuff has an admirably small impact on tree construction code",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:50): most of the changes were related to adding a namespace parameter all over",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:50): which thankfully is the kind of stuff Eclipse is really good at",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (17:53): b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f, http://www.geonet.org.nz/volcano/volcams/whiteisland/whiteisland-recent.html",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:53): what we really need for the alt discussion to get somewhere is a study that looks at the reasons why people use alt=&quot;&quot; or alt=&quot;bogus, validator friendly content&quot; or whatever. The difficulty is in figuring out how to perform such a study",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:54): maybe a carefully crafted survey, asking web developers a bunch of questions about the issue would work",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (17:55): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: no, this is the kind of stuff where you have go look for revealed preferences from actual actions, because if you ask, people lie",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (17:55): ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2: thanks",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (17:55): yeah, but the problem is, how do you unambiguosly determine someone's reasons from simply looking at their output?",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:56): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: You can't, but you can't determine that by any other mechanism either",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (17:56): interview them afterwards",
        "ac35308fff7abada50397bb69d5658e2 (17:56): Welcome to sociology!",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (17:57): attempts to pin down some concrete proposals rather than wordy long-paragaph replies",
        "ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c (17:57): Also, your assumption that people have reasons is not clearly valid",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:00): ab7faae5d7b250ea8606486575f8f79c, people always have reasons for doing something, even if that reason is that they didn't care and just picked one alternative randomly",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:06): if I were to do a presentation on HTML5 at @media, which topics do you think people would like to hear about?",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:06): it looks like the presentations are an hour long, so I could fit a lot in",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (18:10): heh, moving the goalposts is popular sport on public-html",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:11): expects the famous 'axiomatic proof' to show up",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (18:14): I wish I had the time to write a proper reply to Rob today, but it'l have to wait til tomorrow",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:14): b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9, http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1041735552&amp;count=1 ?",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (18:19): 0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17, the image is somewhat random (though it doesn't update too frequently).",
        "b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 (18:23): can foreign elements ever participate in foster-parenting?",
