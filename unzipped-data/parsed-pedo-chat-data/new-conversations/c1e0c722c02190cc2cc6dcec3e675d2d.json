        "4fe573ff41aefb42de56ddf2771295ea (09:43): by 'smp dual core' do you mean multiple single core CPUs?",

        "75dd2071a30b7c94d9361f05f06d524c (09:48): rodrickbrown: depends very much on the application you're running.  the major benefit of multiple cores on the same die is lower latency for coherency related messaging",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (09:49): yeah i figured as much",
        "75dd2071a30b7c94d9361f05f06d524c (09:50): if you can schedule two threads which cooperate to process some common dataset which fits within their combined caches you can see a big speedup over traditional smp",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (09:52): shared cache I think would cause more cache thrashing under heavy load... not too sure though",
        "7ef291c89ad915978b203d427919cfbb (09:52): opterons don't have a shared cache",
        "75dd2071a30b7c94d9361f05f06d524c (09:53): it certainly could if the associativity wasn't increased simultaneously",
        "75dd2071a30b7c94d9361f05f06d524c (09:54): and, yeah, opterons just hook the caches into the crossbar for very fast core-to-core transfers",
        "daa08b04a71644cbce3e6e7e5aeeb58e (09:54): james i was talking in general not specific to opteron i'm actually really excited about intels road map",
