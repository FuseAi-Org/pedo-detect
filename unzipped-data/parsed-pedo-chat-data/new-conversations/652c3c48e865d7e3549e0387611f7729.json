        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:40): i have a lot of questions, and of course for you most of them should be boring, but well, i'm just trying to get a better idea of this",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (05:40): hi f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd",

        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:40): hi",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (05:40): what are your questions?",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:41): well, many of them, after reading here and there, and trying to think a little, usually have one thing in common and that is, When and why was the necessity of joining html and xhtml born?",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:42): or may be i should rephrase that",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:42): ?",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (05:43): well, they've always been joined, in that xhtml is an xml dialect of the html language",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:43): yes, that's true",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:44): but the line was evolving/changing in one direction and now it seems a bit chaotic ...",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:44): i mean",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (05:45): yes, there was a fork: xhtml2 went one direction and, well, everyone else went another",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:45): ha ha ha",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:45): yes, specially when they wrote that the v2 won't be backwards compatible ...",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:46): but reading some of their material in the list, it seems that at the end, it won't be as differente, if it makes it till the end, of course",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:46): i meant that different",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:48): i suppose that part of the chaos feling comes from two main areas, at least for me, one is the extremely complex specification of html 5, and the mess in the w3c lists",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (05:49): yeah",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:49): for instance, the changes in css3, using namespaces, plus the overlapping with the html group and the xhtml group, and things like that ...",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (05:49): the html5 spec is complex, but not as complex as browsers :)",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:49): that's true",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:50): i'm sure they are complex, specially adding more and more features",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:51): and of course the idea of a browser behaving purist is 100% unachievable",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (05:51): purity doesn't matter, only interoperability. it doesn't matter what browsers do, as long as they all do the same thing",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:52): well, yeah, which we know it is not happenning",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:52): but they are behaving closer, i think ...",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:52): at least in many aspects, common aspects",
        "6905646aa63b96d6bdfbd256603fa58e (05:52): right, things are getting better. and i think the whatwg has facilitated that",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:53): well, i know this is not the best place to say it, but i don't know if the whatwg, but the people that forms it ...",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:53): and with that i mean",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:54): that the people in the group have been fighting for get thigs right, or better, or easier, most of them are kind of icons or referents you can use to follow or to help develop yourself (myself)",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:55): and for that, i'm ver very thankful",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:56): but about the html5 thing, i'm still, reluctant in may aspects, mainly with reasons, why's and the linke, and agree with many of the contents and ideas ...",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:56): i don't know if i that was clear enough?",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (05:58): are you asking a question or just thinking out loud? :)",
        "c8aeee312a8f3d58481adfac2c60bb29 (05:58): annevk:  because despite outward appearances, i do have other work I need to do :)",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (05:59): sorry for that ...",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (06:00): yes, i had questions, and some of them are not that straight forward ...",
        "f49d17cd629a1717e4d791aca76a54bd (06:00): so, i'l try to write that in the forum ...",
