        "6bdf4521165fe0d0fae23a0112289d95 (10:27): not really sure, could search the site and see, but normally anything that works decently with opengl shouldn't have too many problems",
        "605673fb864873aea034d89fe079ad4c (10:28): I have no idea if I even have OpenGL on here... I guess I must do since it works otherwise. I just wanted to play with a model a friend is drawing, but ... I may just throw it in the trash.",
