        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:22): can I setup HA with Oracle XE ?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:22): depends on what you mean with HA",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:23): you can put oracle xe on a shared disk system and have an active/passive setup",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:23): hm",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:23): or use poor mans dataguard (scripts to sync logfiles and apply)",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:23): I usually put master and hot standby",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:23): heartbeat + single ip",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:24): sure no problem",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:24): as long as you have the backend to support it",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:24): I need SAN also here, right ?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:24): no",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:24): a good scsi array will do fine",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:25): take a dell 220 with dual cluster compatible controllers and raid cards (perc4dc)",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:25): or a hp msa array... or ibm exp",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:25): and attach it to 2 boxes ?",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:25): slave and master right ?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:25): yes",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:26): scsi array becomes a point of failure then ?",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:26): yes and no... it is very very unlikely that the array will fail so badly that it will cause downtime",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:26): you have two controllers in the array",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:26): the only non-redundant part will be the backplane and the enclosure itself",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:27): i don't think i've ever seen a normal scsi backplane die",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:27): use two arrays if you are paranoid... performance will be quite sucky tho",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:27): and you need a cluster aware software raid solution (vxvm)",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:28): hm",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:28): or gfs from redhat/centos",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:29): i'm implementing a small ha system in a few weeks... two dell 2950's and a dell ax150 array.. very cheap",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:29): SE",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:29): and redhat cluster server",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:29): with ocfs",
        "e3bece16a9b102049571aab163e47582 (18:31): hm",
        "c7f657e53de73d701a201d626b0a78d7 (18:31): you can probably do a mirrored disk situation with two cabinets without a clustered filesystem",
        "c7f657e53de73d701a201d626b0a78d7 (18:32): though I agree with hali, that's pretty paranoid",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:32): most basic raid controllers don't support split bus mirroring... i have asked hp and dell about it... you can't use four raid cards and two arrays in HW mode :(",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:32): you can probably use two cards with dual ports tho...",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:33): thats probably a decent solution",
        "c7f657e53de73d701a201d626b0a78d7 (18:33): right, not in hw mode",
        "c7f657e53de73d701a201d626b0a78d7 (18:33): it'd be software",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:34): hm, asm should be able to do it when i think of it",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:35): using mirroring in asm.. should be a quite clean solution",
        "443a9547033ec9d695ae9d29e8df98b1 (18:35): without cluster filesystems and extra software raid layers..."
