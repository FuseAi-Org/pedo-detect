        "f79b910ed55c817c3286ef127fa464fc (08:24): I really want to know what the hiring manager asked you in the interview that convinced him you are the right candidate despite the fact you probably had mentioned to him of your lack of experience with Perl.",
        "caa6d297c180089f6078e94288312156 (08:24): They had no idea Perl would be part of the plan",
        "caa6d297c180089f6078e94288312156 (08:24): They figured that was my job to work out",
        "f79b910ed55c817c3286ef127fa464fc (08:24): I mean, either a position requires certain criteria that the candidate MUST meet or else...",

        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (08:30): kismet my suggestion would get awesome at one tech and pretty good on a handful of others",
        "f79b910ed55c817c3286ef127fa464fc (08:31): Haha, Perl is just a glorified version of assembly... Syntax wise.",
        "4a75696134c268cf1b58158c11986d95 (08:31): except when you write assembly you cant just 'hack it' like you can with perl",
