        "3f9e24f372de1c18c3993ee5f9f1adcd (00:06): And it sounds like something that could cause some pretty heavy random io load. =)",

        "246c3b99c9da4707df319c508d66a22a (00:22): Something's seriously wrong with the new blastwave I got, perhaps: now gaim is 1165MB in size, iowait is 85%. I killed fc-cache long ago.",

        "72bac19ca0a2ff15f99326a8f7e02c10 (00:26): If that stuff starts before the font caches exist, it tends to behave badly.",
