        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (22:04): I think some are saying -- look how scary the web will be if we don't clamp down on grammar now",
        "ca4923f2d198f6bbff488e483461b3bc (22:05): some seem to have something else going on",

I was going to try to learn XSLT this semester until this WG came along.  Maybe this summer. Shouldn't be much activity this summer should there be?  Don't all you folks take big summer vacations?  ;)"
