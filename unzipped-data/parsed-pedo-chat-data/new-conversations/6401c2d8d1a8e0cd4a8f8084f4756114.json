        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (20:52): Probably one of the biggest failings in the web standards world",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (20:53): The group responsible for CSS mostly appears interested in print and documents",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (20:54): Though to be fair grid layout is more seriously being worked on now",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (20:55): 467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db: It has been &quot;being worked on&quot; for a long time. There have been drafts since at least 2000 right?",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (20:55): I don't think so",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (20:56): I think flex is really cool, but there's nobody to really drive it :/",
        "5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67 (20:56): Wasn't Hixie planning to pull a WHATWG on the CSSWG?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (20:57): It is pretty sad that Mozilla havn't managed to drive it to completion",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (20:57): Though we do have a draft of it now: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/",
        "5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67 (20:57): Somewhere around 2023",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (20:57): But that is the old draft",
        "467f6d43402c6573237052cefcc252db (20:57): 5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67, we need an editor first :)",
        "5b67d980ae4c3c82251106e26913ce67 (20:58): By that time we can clone people",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (20:59): awesome",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (20:59): I hope he is able to finish it soon",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (21:01): problem with flex is that it's 1D; it's not grids",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (21:02): there was some 2D flex proposal floating around based on tables, but only in email and very vague",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (21:02): Does XUL have more than that?",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (21:02): If webapps can have good enough layout primitives to do everything that XUL can do it is a huge win",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (21:03): XUL has some kind of weird grid model besides flex",
        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (21:03): from what I heard we don't wanna copy that",

        "3147b7f83160b7c2b4223cb8126f2b52 (21:24): but the current draft of the HTML5 spec was vague, but I read it as meaning a single 'article' per article...",
        "3147b7f83160b7c2b4223cb8126f2b52 (21:24): yeah, I ignored that since I didn't read the HTML5 draft that way at all",

        "6d05f0c2942adc25946a4b02b37ffa00 (21:38): maybe the competition gets all up in terminology all the time though and competes using &quot;element&quot; rather than &quot;tag&quot;",
