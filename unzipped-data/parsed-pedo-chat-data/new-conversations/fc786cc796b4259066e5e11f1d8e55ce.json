        "7c8fd3e81e6b000427aa2579afeffab8 (12:07): yacek, its the same as in QFrame, QWidget, yada yada",
        "77f22a3a6bad707d556f2e73c4280563 (12:07): when I create some layout with groupbox as a parent, this layout is outside the groupbox",

        "7c8fd3e81e6b000427aa2579afeffab8 (12:18): now all you have to do is wait for someone who actually writes their layout code, sorry i cant really help you, im a designer n00b :)",

        "84a26c4612a7f9958174ee6552625282 (12:51): According to the (short) QCA doc I was first putting libqca-tls.so into the QT plugins directory - no effect.",
        "84a26c4612a7f9958174ee6552625282 (12:52): Then I was putting it into the /usr/lib/ directory and editing the Makefile of Psi, adding &quot;-lqca-tls&quot; to LIBS - no effect.",
        "84a26c4612a7f9958174ee6552625282 (12:53): Eventually I have found out that the missing symbols may actually not be inside my libqca-tls.so.",

        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (12:56): maybe the &quot;tls&quot; lib is just one plugin for qca?",
        "e5c246c422bf5aeed2dab4c68c680e2b (12:56): ie there could be a libqca-ssl.so or similar?",

        "84a26c4612a7f9958174ee6552625282 (13:00): And besides this single (empty) definition in the header it isn't used anywhere else in the QCA source dir.",
        "84a26c4612a7f9958174ee6552625282 (13:01): Anywhere here who has libqca-tls.so installed as well and can check whether it contains symbols like &quot;isSupported&quot;?",
