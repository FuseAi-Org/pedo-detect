        "d962a9ee7861da9561c24bee5655e62c (12:48): Has anyone been able to get automatic registration with updates.sun.com during jumpstart using autoRegistrationProfile.xml?",
        "f8312ee38e61cd51a71563a13a061642 (12:50): Hey. I have a kind of problem with the installation of Solaris :(   I'm unable to use my keyboard as soon as I get to the &quot;Select Installation&quot; page. Which is the first one. Thereafter (after 30 sec or something), it automatically selects the highlighted one, and then ask for a language, which I can't select due to the keyboard error... Does anyone have a clue?",

        "d962a9ee7861da9561c24bee5655e62c (13:14): The solaris kernel is amazing, it's everything else that sucks.  They still haven't figured out package mamagement in 2006, basically all the userspace stuff is shite",

        "92797ef488b7b1fff4342c6ba6b02c69 (13:16): pakace management in ubuntu is the same as in debian, as its based on debian in the first place",

        "d962a9ee7861da9561c24bee5655e62c (13:18): freebs might go further if the binary ports things catches on until then on sadists will use it ;)",
        "d962a9ee7861da9561c24bee5655e62c (13:18): Still rather use ports than sun packages though",
