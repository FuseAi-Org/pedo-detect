        "5e7ea781779a9b70a013bb242c722fea (04:40): well then discard the db, downgrade mysql, and install the proper db",

        "249d0f31dbc263a7898b426d8cc535bc (04:41): I think so, might have compiled it, but it was probably the binaries",
        "09a56028a63f8e9351a49d2f8c51f8df (04:42): then you can probably just download the 4.1 or 4.0 osx binaries from mysql, delete everything from the datadir and start the 4.x binaries",
        "09a56028a63f8e9351a49d2f8c51f8df (04:42): oh, after running mysql_install_db for 4.1/4.0",
