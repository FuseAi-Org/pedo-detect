        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:48): the first paragraph is mine, but the other references to microformats belong to others.",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:48): before I mess around with everyone elses wording, I want to talk to them (people at AP)",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:49): but the relevant people are all on holiday",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:51): 793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d perhaps you could add yourself to http://microformats.org/wiki/irc-people",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:52): oh there you are!",

        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:52): welcome - I have to go for a bit but will be back later tonight.",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:53): sorry, this is an old old IRC nickname",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:53): and I still have nickserv/chanserv for other channels attached to it !",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:54): I'll be starting on the history/changesets brainstorming stuff tomorrow",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:54): catch you soon.",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:54): also, I spoke to people at AP about the rights/machine readable issue",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:55): it's now understood at their end and they're going to consider their next move",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:56): 793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d - see and add to http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom-brainstorming",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:56): history, or rights ?",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:56): ahh, yes",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:56): history",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:56): will do",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:57): and http://microformats.org/wiki/licensing-brainstorming",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:57): history? that's not part of the proposal AFAIk",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:57): and &quot;rights&quot; is problematic - not even worth exploring making a format for it",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:57): licensing that links to a human readable URL yes, machine-encoded rights no.",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:58): we're not going to repeat ccREL's mistakes.",

        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:58): understood",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:58): and the message has been passed on and understood at AP, too",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:58): at least at a technical level",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:59): I think the next step there is actually a conversation between organisations like AP and Creative Commons themselves",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:59): and working on item-license",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:59): yeah we need to engage Creative Commons more broadly to encourage far simpler markup",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:59): there's another thing that AP found interesting though, and that's the idea of embedding a licensing contact",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (05:59): the ccREL/RDFa stuff they have going/encouraging now is a non-starter to most webdevs",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (05:59): but that behaviour needs to be established before it's worth it becoming a microformat.",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (06:00): &quot;embedding&quot; is for anything that is text is the wrong framing",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (06:00): it should always &quot;just&quot; be marking up",
        "793d2c8119ea35466c485b1887b61b7d (06:00): right, wrong choice of language, rather than concept on my part",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (06:00): that is, anything that is text based should already be visible in the content, and the markup should simply ideally demarcate it",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (06:01): right - in things like formats, choice of language is important",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (06:01): I think before engaging Creative Commons on a technical level, we should have a &quot;licensing&quot; microformat draft ready to engage with",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (06:01): otherwise the likely answer will be &quot;use RDFa for everything&quot;",
        "3c1a153d81002878b83df957ee534f47 (06:02): anyway - be back in a while"
