        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:24): in what world does it make sense to talk about websockets messages being &quot;dispatched using the platform's mime mechanism&quot;?",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:36): I haven't followed along on that conversation, 69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:36): although, some of the things proposed do sound a little bit more complicated then what's needed",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:55): ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2: it's not so much that they're complicated so much as as far as i can tell, they make no sense at all",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:55): it'd be like if someone was talking about how HTTP should allow you to change nick",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:55): okay, similar idea",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (09:55): or if someone was talking about how IRC didn't let you select the printer driver",
        "ad7340c0d2664b131f969961d78c86b2 (09:56): well of course irc should let you choose your printer driver, isn't that what your irc server does?",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:10): I have no idea why you would want that",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:21): e.g. there was lots of stuff about doing dispatch based on content-type",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:22): But in most websockets cases I can think of, that makes no sense",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:22): Anyway, my conclusion is that the whole thing is just a bad idea because it is additional complexity",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:22): and makes the protocol less generic",
        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:23): I am more worried by real issues like framing / the handshake",

        "b25b6b77a0087ff8385941e5545d32ea (10:29): For the framing there is a tenion between the belief that sentinal markers are more secure when sending, and that it is harder to write the recieving code",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:30): the only change i'm aware of for wss: is the minor addition of the hook into the nextprotoneg feature",
