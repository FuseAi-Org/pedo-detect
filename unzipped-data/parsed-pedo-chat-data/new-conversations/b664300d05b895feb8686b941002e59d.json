        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (21:53): it would be nice if we just developed a nice web based tool which could take an SVG image, strip out all the namespaced stuff that would be non-conforming in HTML and send back the image to the user ready to copy and paste into their HTML",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (21:53): though, maybe it would have to replace the creative commons stuff with a simpler, conforming alternative that means the same thing",
        "1f8387eb43f131d7c309a90a4e36b5cb (22:17): Should be easy if you have an XML dom, right?",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:22): should be fairly easy to make as a Python app",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:22): (I say that because I know a bit of Python)",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (22:35): yeah, and as long as the input is well formed XML, then it shouldn't be too hard. But if we want to handle some non-well-formed input, or input with namespace errors, and be able to output valid SVG for text/html, it would be harder",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (22:37): btw, that Wikipedia logo in text/html page that Shelley made really makes Firefox slow to use",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:38): you could use my XML5 code",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:38): but euh, I thought the point was copy and pasting well-formed XML",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:40): you could probably also just use html5lib and filter out the implied &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt; crap",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (22:40): yeah, but we know authors don't always make XML based SVG well formed",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:40): we also know that content doesn't work",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:41): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, hey",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (22:42): using html5lib would put all the namespaced stuff like &lt;dc:foo&gt; and prefixed attributes into the wrong namespace, so filtering wouldn't be as simple as stripping out anything that isn't in the SVG, MathML or HTML namespace, nor an atribute in no namespace",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:42): hey 4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:42): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, I was wondering if http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SafariJSDatabaseGuide/OfflineApplicationCache/OfflineApplicationCache.html is correct for WebKit as it seems like it contradicts HTML5 for fallback entries",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:42): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, I asked in #webkit earlier but nobody was around that could help",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:43): 4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b: that documentation could be out of date, but it's also possible the implementation is out of date with the spec",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:43): 4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b: what's the specific point of contradiction?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (22:44): 4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b: andersca is the person most likely to know offhand, for me to know the exact current behavior I would need to test",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:45): 65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c, it suggests that for a fallback thingy of /foo/ /bar/ a failed load of /foo/1.htm loads /bar/1.htm where as HTML5 suggests it should load /bar/",
        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:47): I haven't tested myself. Did find that the Firefox documentation does support my interpretation of HTML5...",

        "4d647473081c3ad729446a01a377813b (22:48): kk, I pinged andersca just in case",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (22:49): changes topic to 'WHATWG (HTML5) -- http://www.whatwg.org/ -- Logs: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/ -- Vennligst legg igjen din logiske sans ved d??ren, takk!'",
        "57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450 (22:52): Leave your sense of logic at the door in... Norwegian?",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:01): 57d876083caf517f49e8cf5e03307450: sort of",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:01): the original seems to have been auto-translated initially",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (23:01): 0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17, yeah, google translate helped me a little bit with a few words in the original",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:01): it's now valid Norwegian, but a bit strained, and we would never say &quot;thank you&quot;",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (23:02): 0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17, that's just because norwegians are impolite :-)",

        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:02): it's just that &quot;, takk&quot; in Norwegian implies that you expect compliance",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:02): so instead of being a polite request, it's now a fairly rude way of ordering people around",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (23:03): then let's change it back to the english version, which doesn't suffer from that problem",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:03): Now it, pretty directly is &quot;Be polite and leave your sense of logic at the door&quot;",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:04): s/directly/literally/",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:04): but the implied translation changes &quot;v?\u00b6r vennlig&quot; to &quot;please&quot;",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (23:04): Google translate says otherwise: &quot;Please leave your logical sense at the door&quot;. But I suppose I can trust your translation a little more",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:04): please, though, directly would translate to &quot;be kind&quot;",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:04): or &quot;be so kind&quot;",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:05): (v?\u00b6r s?\u2022 snill)",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (23:05): ah, like vars?\u2022god in Swedish",

        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (23:06): oh, so those signs I've seen around that say things like &quot;Vennligst vent her&quot; are ordering me around, instead of making a polite request?",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:09): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220: pretty much, yes",

        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:11): it's not like in dutch airports",
        "0da07476c4bd14079ce4032a6f280e17 (23:11): where their last call messages are saying &quot;[Insert name], proceed to gate immediately, you are delaying the flight&quot;",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (23:15): I wish IRC were more resillient to this kind of server adjustments, without causing so many splits",
        "88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762 (23:21): f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220, every other chat protocol seems not to have this problem . . .",
        "b07211a0c7cb119232799d2119cea90f (23:22): IRC is *old* though",
        "f139aba52f9fa1394b4034a7954b2220 (23:22): 88d4d34a8064a4ff39fd5e144eea7762, it's not really surprising. IRC is one of the oldest chat protocols still in common use. Newer protocols probably learned from its shortcomings"
