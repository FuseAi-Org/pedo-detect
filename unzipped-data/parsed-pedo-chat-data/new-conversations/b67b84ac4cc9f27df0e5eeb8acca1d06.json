        "62e8f44c528751bc52ab458d2b8886ee (02:20): ZanQdo, i would think it's very useful for hi-res models but totally useless for low-res game models",

        "28d5ade3858119655f5dda950d98b297 (02:36): ya, that's fantastic. I asked him about it a while back, because it's what I've wanted ever since the modifier stack was coded, and he told me what the difficulty of it was",
        "9fecb5f788ca4f471b210e9dca724d53 (02:38): yeah, he said vertex groups are related to objects and not meshes or something like that",
        "9fecb5f788ca4f471b210e9dca724d53 (02:38): anyway hes one smart coder, I'm sure he will find a way",

        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (03:15): how do I set a texture to show on each side of the cube? setting map input to Cube doesn't seem to do anything",
        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (03:16): oh",
        "87103c73f1d4ebce7a0d0f7cc72fd19d (03:16): it helps if you select the right texture first, apparently",
        "13c252ae27b88f703dc1806b696bb3c4 (03:24): the normals determine which side of the face the texture is applied to.  I think there might be an option to make a poly 2-sided, but I've not had the need to do that before",
