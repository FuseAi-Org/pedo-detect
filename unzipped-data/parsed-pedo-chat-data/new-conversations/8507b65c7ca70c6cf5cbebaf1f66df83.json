Inside are a series of nested DIVs, all properly closed the correct number of times and order.  The code validates.  Only IE6 displays my background 100%.  FF, O, and S do not.",

There's a special case in CSS that only applies to HTML (not XML, XHTML parsed as XML, etc.): If a background is set on the body and not on the html element, the background actually gets applied to the html element instead of the body",

        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (20:03): That's one of the common errors when people try to use XHTML sent as text/html. Get it parsed as XML (which most browsers usually don't do in that case) and suddenly the background is screwy",
        "01f60b3e30620d99648888f668e7da88 (20:04): The special case was made to account for the fact that the body is usually given a *margin* when, in terms of the background, it sort of acts like padding.",
        "a78e826fd473944f0278df2006700c9f (20:06): Now, strangely to me, when I inspect the body (which is set to 100%) the DOM node blinks and is demonstrably shorter than its actual content.  Very confusing, when I'm trying to figure out where all this extra space at the bottom came from.",
