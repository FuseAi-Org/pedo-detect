        "389d940242efd923293a222c0013f176 (04:27): Hello, when I use cifs (as opposed to smbfs) to mount a network share on my Linux 2.6 workstation, from a samba server on linux 2.6, ls -la tells me the permissions are fine on those files, but if I try to cat a file that is on the network share I get permission denied",
        "389d940242efd923293a222c0013f176 (04:27): Anyone know why?",

        "ce12c17d8f6af1418d5b28d3db4b21c4 (04:35): evilgod, cifs vfs will give you access only to the files the user you use to authenticate to has access",

        "ce12c17d8f6af1418d5b28d3db4b21c4 (04:36): evilgod, root does not give you any special access, as the access is determined by the server",
        "389d940242efd923293a222c0013f176 (04:36): idra: which should be fine",
        "389d940242efd923293a222c0013f176 (04:36): idra: yes, but I authenticate as toxik, and those files are owned by toxik..",
        "389d940242efd923293a222c0013f176 (04:36): I can read dirs (list content etc) but not read files",

        "ce12c17d8f6af1418d5b28d3db4b21c4 (04:37): evilgod, it depends on how you mount it I think, you can specify whch user to map the credentials too",
        "389d940242efd923293a222c0013f176 (04:38): idra: the share is //odin/home, and that points to /home/%U on the smb server",
        "389d940242efd923293a222c0013f176 (04:38): so I know for sure that it's authenticated as the correct user",

        "52cf9b6be08072680726a19215c5a416 (04:52): idra, i mean when you try to conenct to a network share it askes for user/pass.....it then stores them........if those user/pas sare changed on the server then they obviously won't work.....how do i erase the stored creds from windows?",
        "ce12c17d8f6af1418d5b28d3db4b21c4 (04:52): AngryElf, unmap the share (net use /delete will help)",

        "52cf9b6be08072680726a19215c5a416 (04:55): i didn't map it",
