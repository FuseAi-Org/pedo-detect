        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (22:44): so i had to take out the small external hard drive i had (it was empty) pop it into my laptop, reinstall windows, install the wifi drivers, install nero and then burn the gwscan ISO image",
        "02e08f381a12d3947303164df6615613 (22:44): then pop out the hard drive, put the dead one back in and scan it and then submit the error to gateway",

        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (22:45): Yeah",

        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (22:48): Yeah, but the guy wanted another HDD, so he put the second one in, and it booted into Ubuntu, which was installed there",
        "5b8a284fa662b200c0d6b94314f7fc48 (22:48): So I installed the newest Ubuntu, and was able to mount the Windows drive that was along side the new hard drive",
