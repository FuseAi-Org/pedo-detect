        "66b0d785bfa15d051888c24dabba7342 (10:04): I think we want to make it as trivial as possible to handle the typical multi-language subtitle case, i.e. mutually exclusive &lt;track&gt;s",
        "66b0d785bfa15d051888c24dabba7342 (10:05): still, allowing for parallell tracks of some kinds seems reasonable.",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (10:38): updates the IDL definitions",

        "66b0d785bfa15d051888c24dabba7342 (11:00): oh, nice figure: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Timed_tracks#Architecture",

        "66b0d785bfa15d051888c24dabba7342 (11:02): so, looks like the intention is that CSS applied to &lt;video&gt; cascades to the external tracks, which I guess does make sense if one wants to style multiplexed tracks too (cc cc097e0d7183ae8436e7df709553c8c0)",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:36): so if you insert a &lt;track&gt;, it renumbers existing tracks?",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:36): that'd be a bit weird",
        "fe70b49783daa65bcb249805fb3a2b24 (11:37): you could do the media resource, then external tracks, in which case you can avoid any renumering by always appending",
        "66b0d785bfa15d051888c24dabba7342 (11:37): I think with multiple &lt;source&gt;s where only some have internal tracks would be worse, where the script breaks because the order changed",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:38): btw there's also a third source, which is scripted tracks",
        "fe70b49783daa65bcb249805fb3a2b24 (11:39): I don't think you can avoid renumbering when you add &lt;track&gt;s in the DOM then",
        "fe70b49783daa65bcb249805fb3a2b24 (11:39): unless you give up on the track state being inferrable from the DOM",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:40): well we can add them in first-come-first-served, which trades predictability from run to run for consistency of the index of the objects in the array",
        "66b0d785bfa15d051888c24dabba7342 (11:40): it's quite likely not all browsers will detect the same resource-internal tracks during a period of implementation, which favors putting them at the end where it creates a smaller mess",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:40): or we can do them in a defined order, in which case you can't keep a hold of the position... but then you can keep hold of the object that represents the track, so that's ok",
        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:40): ok, fair enough",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:41): should the &lt;track&gt; ones be sorted in the order they were inserted into the &lt;Video&gt; element, or in DOM order? I guess the latter, if they are removed when you remove the &lt;Track&gt; element",
        "edb259c0e0038f38bb200bc20c8cbf7e (11:45): DOM order is what most collections do",

        "69b0d3dfe919a6b860a9fac82de52a7e (11:46): should it be possible to dynamically change a track's kind, label, and language?",
        "65325d50b2e25aca54bc871b89758c9c (11:47): if it's represented by an element and those things are attributes, it would be weird if you couldn't",
